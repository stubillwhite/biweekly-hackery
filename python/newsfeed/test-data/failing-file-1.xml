<h2 class="wp-block-heading">If you&#8217;re internally promoting your managers and creating a career path framework for managers, keep these 5 considerations in mind.</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="446" src="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3-essential-tips-1024x446.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8475"/></figure>



<p>&#8220;Do we have a career path framework for managers?&#8221; asks one of your newly promoted managers. You knowingly nod:  While you don&#8217;t have a career path framework for managers <em>yet</em>, it&#8217;s something that&#8217;s currently on your to-do list or &#8220;in the works.&#8221; You&#8217;re likely the only person who makes up your People Team at the company at the moment (or one of just a few folks on the People Team) – and you&#8217;re strapped for time. This is one of many initiatives you have on your never-ending list&#8230;</p>



<p>Once you do get to it, woosh! What a time-intensive process creating a career path framework for managers can be. Research, matrixes, to-dos, surveys&#8230; It can feel like months before you&#8217;re able to roll something out. </p>



<p>As a result, to help save you time in your process, I wanted to zero-in on the 5 most important considerations when creating a career path framework for managers.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-first-things-first-what-is-a-career-path-framework"><strong>First things first:  What is a career path framework?</strong></h3>



<p>At its core, a career path framework is <strong>an expectation-setting tool.</strong> It helps make clear to an employee – and to upper leadership – what the opportunities for growth and career advancement look like in an organization.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/training/organizations/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=careerpatharticle" rel="sponsored nofollow">internally promoting your managers at your organization</a>, a strong career path framework helps then set the expectation for growth and promotion. But also, it helps sets a standard for what &#8220;good&#8221; actually looks like as a manager, so they can perform at the highest level.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why is it useful?</strong></h3>



<p>Practically, an organization can use a career path framework to:</p>



<ul><li>Set expectations for what positive growth looks like, so employees can feel a sense of forward progression in their careers and feel more focused in their work</li><li>Help with retention, as a lack of growth opportunities is one of the primary reasons that top-performing employees leave especially&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/the-great-attrition-is-making-hiring-harder-are-you-searching-the-right-talent-pools" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in 2022</a></li><li>Help frame growth conversations and give a reference for employees to know what core competencies and skills to improve</li><li>Set expectations for how to achieve a promotion</li><li>Set salary expectations</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The 5 most important considerations when creating a career path framework for managers:</strong></h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">#1:  <strong>Get clear on defining what &#8220;good&#8221; is. </strong></h4>



<p>Start googling &#8220;what makes a good leader,&#8221; and after thousands of search results, it can be hard to distill down as you create your career path framework. </p>



<p>As a result, we here at <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=careerpatharticle">Know Your Team,</a> have distilled the definition of &#8220;good leadership&#8221; for you.</p>



<p>Based on our research over the past 10 years, the 3 core competencies we&#8217;ve identified that are most critical for a leader to learn are:  <strong>Trust, Context, and Honesty.</strong> Feel free to cite these three core competencies as the basis of your manager career path framework.</p>



<p>Specifically, you may want to visit these resources on how to define what it means to be a &#8220;good leader&#8221; for your career path framework for managers:</p>



<ul><li><strong><a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/webinars/650-how-to-create-a-leadership-operating-model" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Watch:  How to create a leadership operating model</a>. </strong>This essential 60-minute webinar shares the playbook on how to define in-depth &#8220;good leadership&#8221; for your managers, and how to create an operating model to help drive &#8220;good&#8221; and consistent behaviors for your managers.</li><li><strong><a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2017/12/01/the-10-qualities-of-a-true-leader/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read:  The 10 qualities of a good leader</a>.  </strong>This article shares the 10 qualities that you can translate into competencies as you design your career path framework for managers. </li><li><strong><a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2019/11/07/the-5-essential-expectations-of-a-good-manager/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read: 5 essential expectations of a good manager</a>.</strong> This article shared the 5 critical expectations of &#8220;good managers&#8221; that you can infuse into your career path frameworks. </li></ul>



<p></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">#2:  <strong>Spend a disproportionate amount of time on helping folks decide if they even want to enter the very first &#8220;level.&#8221; </strong></h4>



<p>Does this person actually want to be become a manager in the first place? Do they know what the role really entails and is that truly the <em>kind</em> of growth they are seeking? It&#8217;s easy for folks to say &#8220;I want to be a manager!&#8221; before truly understand what the role requires on a day-to-day basis. </p>



<p>This may be likely the most overlooked aspect of creating a career path framework for managers. <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2019/03/20/do-i-truly-want-to-become-a-manager/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Read our article on  &#8220;Do I truly want to become a manager?&#8221;</strong></a> to help you and the employee in question discern this.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>#3:  Recognize the difference between a frontline manager and manager of managers.</strong></h4>



<p>Going from managing a direct team to managing <em>other</em> managers is a big leap – and one not suited for everyone. When you manage other managers, you become even more removed from the work itself and must operate more as a coach&#8217;s coach, and focus on big picture vision. </p>



<p><a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2019/05/01/managing-managers-hows-it-different/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Read our article on &#8220;Managing Managers&#8221;</strong></a> to help you outline what changes when you become a manager of other managers in your career path framework.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">#4:  <strong>Keep it simple + clear.</strong></h4>



<p>Anything that is convoluted and burdensome will discourage and frustrate your employees. Instead, focus on keeping things simple. For example, don&#8217;t list out 12 different competencies someone needs to have in a role, focus on say three to five.</p>



<p><strong>For reference, are some of career path frameworks for managers that over companies have instituted:</strong></p>



<ul><li><a href="https://buffer.com/resources/career-framework/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Buffer</a></li><li><a href="https://www.intercom.com/blog/evolving-your-product-management-career-ladder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Intercom</a></li><li><a href="https://gist.github.com/jamtur01/aef437a79fee5a9cefdc#file-ladder-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kickstarter</a></li><li><a href="https://engineering.atspotify.com/2016/02/spotify-technology-career-steps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a></li></ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">#5:  Support your managers to enact their career path</h4>



<p>There are few worse feelings than having a high bar set for you&#8230; without any clear path to get there. As a result, when you create your career path framework for managers, <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/training/organizations?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=careerpatharticle">you want to clearly answer for your managers:  &#8220;How you can improve your skills as a manager?&#8221;</a> Otherwise, you leave your managers hanging and feeling stifled in their growth.</p>



<p>To help your managers improve in each of these core competencies, <strong>use our <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/training/organizations?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=careerpatharticle">Manager Training Platform</a> – it&#8217;s the fastest, most effective way to upskill your managers</strong> towards each of those core competencies (e.g., giving feedback, setting direction, etc.). This way, you&#8217;re <em>not just listing out</em> core competencies in your career path framework, but supporting your leaders to <em>achieve</em> those core competencies.</p>



<p>Start here with these 5 considerations when creating a career path framework for your managers. Each of these considerations will help you accelerate your process so you get most quickly enable your managers to be performing at the highest level.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-today-a-dream-of-ours-comes-true-we-re-launching-our-online-leadership-training-product-for-first-time-managers">Today, a dream of ours comes true: We&#8217;re launching <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/training?utm_source=blog">our online leadership training product</a> for first-time managers.</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/training?utm_source=blog"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/training-for_individuals-hero-ec473b56eb47feec1b033a3357412cc8d37c4e04c3493983dea7f3eaa82d05bd-1-1024x768.png" alt="Leadership training product" class="wp-image-7832"/></a></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-dream-realized">A dream realized</h3>



<p>Today, we&#8217;re launching a product we&#8217;ve been envisioning for the past decade: A single place online where you can learn how to become a better leader.</p>



<p><a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/training?utm_source=blog">Introducing our Manager Learning Path</a> – an all-in-one online learning platform for first-time managers based on research over the past 50 years. It&#8217;s what I personally wish I&#8217;d had access to over 10 years ago when I was first starting out as a leader.</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t wait for you to see it for yourself. You can <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/training?utm_source=blog">join the waitlist here.</a></p>



<p>But first, how did we get here?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="not-so-dreamy-beginnings">Not-so-dreamy beginnings</h3>



<p>Early in my career, I had a boss who helped me become the leader I am today, more than anyone else.</p>



<p>But it wasn&#8217;t because they were a good leader: It&#8217;s because they were the opposite. They were a model of the leader I never wanted to become.</p>



<p>I’ll never forget the negative impact that had on me. How poor leadership at work affected my mood, my mental health, my happiness even outside of work.</p>



<p>I vowed to never become a “bad boss” myself and fall into that trap&#8230;</p>



<p>So, I decided to devote my working life to answering that question: What does it actually mean to be a great leader? And how do you learn to become one?</p>



<p>After a decade&#8217;s worth of work, we&#8217;ve discovered the answer to those questions here at <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/training?utm_source=blog">Know Your Team</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-decade's-worth-of-research">A decade&#8217;s worth of research</h3>



<p>Over the past 10 years, we&#8217;ve painstakingly distilled about 50 years worth of leadership literature and studies&#8230; You name it, we&#8217;ve read it, analyzed it, and pulled the meaningful frameworks from it.</p>



<p>From that research, we then dove deep into figuring out the best <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/method?utm_source=blog">way</a> to <em>teach</em> these concepts to leaders. Too often leadership trainings are vague platitudes about how to &#8220;inspire your team&#8221; or &#8220;empower others&#8221; rather than the practical tactics of what to say when someone asks for a raise, or what you should exactly do in your first 90 days when you&#8217;re managing former peers.</p>



<p>We also know the reality of cognitive dissonance: It&#8217;s easy to <em>say</em> you&#8217;re going to change how you operate as a leader, and much harder to actually <em>do</em> it. As a result, we studied learning science principles and human behavior change to tap into helping leaders not just <em>say</em> they&#8217;re going to change their ways – but truly <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=47062">do</a> so.</p>



<p>Then, we <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/training?utm_source=blog">channeled</a> all these learnings into training over 20,000+ people over the past decade at companies as small as 10 people and as large as 100,000+ people.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="real-results">Real results</h3>



<p>After participating in our trainings, people would regularly tell us things like this:</p>



<p>“Most attendees said it was <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/training?utm_source=blog">the best training</a> they’ve ever attended in their professional career and all felt it was super actionable.” &#8211; Emily Allen, Director of People Operations at SEER Interactive</p>



<p>“This workshop was the most concrete and useful workshop I have ever attended.” &#8211; Bekki Freeman, Team Lead at Eggplant</p>



<p>“This workshop was one of the best things I’ve ever done for my professional development.” &#8211; Caro Griffin, Director of Operations at Skillcrush</p>



<p>“I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this for anyone who is a new manager. Just do it.&#8221; &#8211; Jeff Grigg, Project Manager at Guideware Software</p>



<p>We were blown away by the reaction. So much so, we knew we had to help even <em>more</em> leaders.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="helping-the-motivated,-not-just-the-bankrolled">Helping the motivated, not just the bankrolled</h3>



<p>While our live trainings were helpful, we realized small organizations – or individual managers on their own – couldn&#8217;t afford a full blown custom leadership training program that we were offering.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/training?utm_source=blog">leaders who were motivated</a> to become better didn&#8217;t always have their interest matched by their supervisors – it was like pulling teeth to get their boss to &#8220;sign off&#8221; to invest in leadership training.</p>



<p>Another way of looking at it is, here at <a href="https://knowyourteam.com?utm_source=blog">KYT</a>, we realized that people like ourselves – folks at small companies – couldn&#8217;t benefit directly from what we were doing. So we decided to build a learning product for them&#8230; and in a weird way, for us too.</p>



<p>A product that you could start anytime, and use anytime on your own schedule (rather than a commitment of full work days or week-long programming).</p>



<p>A product that didn&#8217;t cost and arm and a leg (organizational-wide leadership training or 1:1 executive coaching is typically tens of thousands of dollars).</p>



<p>A product that helped you lead in a tone and approach you would like to use: Warm and direct, honest and kind. Not corporate-y. Not &#8220;I know better than thou.&#8221;</p>



<p>A product that was rooted in research, rather than the flavor-of-the-day hot trend or a prescriptive view of a singular experience.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/training?utm_source=blog">result</a> is something we feel we&#8217;d personally use – and we can&#8217;t wait for you to benefit from it too.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="that's-our-story.-what's-yours?">That&#8217;s our story. What&#8217;s yours?</h3>



<p>You&#8217;ve been recently promoted and now manage a team of former peers, and are trying to get your bearings as a leader&#8230;</p>



<p>You run a growing team, and you have real stakes and outcomes you need to deliver on as a leader in an ever-changing organizational context&#8230;</p>



<p>You&#8217;re a leader who never had any formal training and are wondering &#8220;if you&#8217;ve been doing it right&#8221;&#8230;</p>



<p>You&#8217;re a manager takes your obligation to your team seriously and wants to make sure you&#8217;re being rigorous and leading thoughtfully&#8230;</p>



<p>If any of this resonates with you, <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/training?utm_source=blog">our product</a> is for you.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="we're-here-for-you">We&#8217;re here for you</h3>



<p>Our <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/training?utm_source=blog">Training product</a> is the closest thing to a &#8220;How to Be a Great Leader Handbook&#8221; that you previously thought did&#8217;t exist. In spending even 30 minutes in it, you&#8217;ll start to feel more confident and be able to make more progress as a leader than before.</p>



<p><a href="https://kyt.tips/training-waitlist-for-individuals-typeform"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f449.png" alt="👉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Join our waitlist today.</strong></a></p>



<p>And if you&#8217;re thinking, &#8220;Oh wow, my organization could benefit from this for all our managers too&#8230;&#8221; you&#8217;ll want to <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/training/organizations?utm_source=blog">check out our Training for Organizations</a>.

<p>Regardless, I&#8217;m grateful that I get an opportunity chance to share our dream here at <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/?utm_source=blog">KYT</a> with you. It&#8217;s not every day that dreams do come true.</p>

Say &#8220;yes&#8221; to these 3 things and &#8220;no&#8221; to these 3 things when managing a growing team.</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="418" src="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/managing-growing-team-part1.png" alt="managing a growing team" class="wp-image-7810"/></figure>



<p>Coupling the words “managing a growing team” and “focus” may seem oxymoronic to you. When your team has doubled its headcount in the past year, when your organization is changing, re-organizing, shifting, re-organizing again – how is it possible to even name&nbsp;<em>only</em>&nbsp;a handful of things to focus on?</p>



<p>Yet, you know the significance of that word:  Focus. </p>



<p>That magic word we know is critical to execution and high performance. In order to execute well as a <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/training?utm_source=blog">leader</a>, we must focus. We must only choose the things that have the highest likelihood of impact, and forget the rest. But to what should we say &#8220;Yes&#8221;? And to what should we say &#8220;no&#8221;?</p>



<p>For instance: Should you look to build trust amongst your team because people don&#8217;t know each other? Should you try to create a sense of stability amidst all the org changes? Should you make sure each person is onboarded well? </p>



<p>Or, should you even do all of the above?</p>



<p>&#8220;All of the above&#8221; is <em>not</em> focus <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Though, the reality of an ever-changing, growing organizational context tempts us try to say &#8220;yes&#8221; to all of it, we must resist. We must be discerning as leaders and choose what is <em>most</em> pressing, if we are to be effective as a leader when managing a growing team.</p>



<p>In this Part 1, I outline below the most important things to lean into and focus on <em>first</em> when managing a growing team – and the things that you can let go by the wayside (at least in the short-term).</p>



<p>Remember, you have to say &#8220;yes&#8221; to some things and &#8220;no&#8221; to other things to focus. Start here.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img decoding="async" width="300" height="126" src="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Untitled_Artwork-2-1-1024x429-1-300x126.png" alt="Context-building clues" class="wp-image-7790"/></figure></div>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Focus on this: Context-building clues.</h3>



<p>You&#8217;re moving fast. A million questions are getting thrown your way while managing a growing team. Your direct reports are asking you: &#8220;Who should I talk to for this?&#8221; &#8220;Do we have any history with this client?&#8221; &#8220;How urgent is this?&#8221; </p>



<p>So you do what many of us do: Start answering all the questions as quickly as possible. Imagine a series of baseball pitches being thrown your way, consecutively, one after the other, non-stop&#8230; and you&#8217;re trying to knock each one of these questions out of the park.</p>



<p>Except there&#8217;s one problem. Every time you answer a question, you get a few more follow-up questions. Then, a week later someone else asks you something similar. The balls you&#8217;re hitting aren&#8217;t just staying in the outfield – they&#8217;re somehow getting thrown <em>back</em> to you.</p>



<p>What to do? This is when context-building clues come in. Every time someone asks you a question, use it as an opportunity to build context on why you&#8217;re answering it that way.</p>



<p>For example:</p>



<p>Someone asks: &#8220;How urgent is this?&#8221; </p>



<p>You answer: &#8220;This is not mission critical and can be pushed to two weeks from now <em>because</em>&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Or here&#8217;s another example:</p>



<p><meta charset="utf-8">Someone asks: &#8220;Who should I talk to about this?&#8221; </p>



<p><meta charset="utf-8">You answer: &#8220;I&#8217;d suggest communicating with the Customer Support and the Product teams <em>because</em>&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Notice how in each answer there is <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2022/06/12/21-questions-to-ask-when-taking-over-a-new-team/?utm_source=blog">context</a> being shared, as though a clue is being dropped for that person to color and fill in the picture for themselves. The essential word here being used is &#8220;because&#8221; – it leads to context being shared every time.</p>



<p>Now, the next question you&#8217;re asked about urgency or stakeholders or whatever it might be, when you answer, you can answer with more context – and you might not have to ever answer that question again!</p>



<p>Yes, it does takes more effort to communicate context-building clues, rather than just answering the question and moving on. But when you do, you help your team both execute and learn, which is foundational to managing a growing team.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Don&#8217;t focus on this: Being an expert.</h3>



<p>You know your stuff. That&#8217;s why you&#8217;re here. You likely were brought into this leadership role because you excelled in a functional area and are seen as an expert.</p>



<p>However, when managing a growing team, you being an <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2018/12/18/the-most-counterintuitive-leadership-tip-leaders-stop-doing-what-youre-good-at/?utm_source=blog">expert</a> doesn&#8217;t matter much anymore. It doesn&#8217;t matter if <em>you</em> know the answer –&nbsp;the team is too big and trying to tackle too much for only <em>you</em> to know the answer. Your <em>team</em> needs to know the answer too.</p>



<p>We must remind ourselves continually that our success as a leader is contingent on finding ways to teach our fellow team members to be more of the expert. Our team must have &#8220;the answers&#8221; as a whole, not only ourselves.</p>



<p>Otherwise, you <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2019/03/06/dont-solve-problems-if-you-want-to-be-a-great-manager/?utm_source=blog">become a bottleneck</a> to a team that has too many smart, talented people to be sitting around waiting for you to be the only one with &#8220;the answer.&#8221;</p>



<p>This can be a rattling identity shift when you realize you no longer need to be the expert in your team anymore, and that you&#8217;re trying to help <em>others</em> become that expert. But it&#8217;s an important one to make when managing a growing team and want the team perform at its highest ability.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-medium"><img decoding="async" width="300" height="125" src="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/hybrid-work-environment-300x125.jpeg" alt="Culture creep" class="wp-image-7789"/></figure></div>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Focus on this: Counteract culture creep.</h3>



<p>An interesting thing happens when a team starts to grow and change: The culture starts to change too. </p>



<p>We&#8217;ve all seen this before. A team that used to pride itself in being innovative slowly becomes scared to make any big changes over time. Or a team that has always excelled at telling each other the truth, over time, gets into the habit of sugar-coating things and avoiding hard conversations. </p>



<p>I call this &#8220;culture creep,&#8221; the inadvertent morphing of a culture into something you didn&#8217;t want.</p>



<p>To counteract culture creep, we must use the only tool we have available to us: Consistent action. After all, <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2018/01/16/the-3-key-elements-of-company-culture-and-why-they-really-matter/?utm_source=blog">culture is the byproduct of consistent action</a>. A culture is what it is simply the actions that comprise it are repeated over and over and over again. A team culture is innovative because team members are consistently taking innovative actions. A team culture is open and forthcoming because team members are consistently taking open and forthcoming actions.</p>



<p>Thus, if there&#8217;s a part of the culture you hope is preserved amidst growth – your team&#8217;s innovativeness, your team&#8217;s candor – then you must find a way to visibly reinforce that with consistent behaviors, over and over and over again.</p>



<p>It might mean blocking out time for your team, once a month, to regularly hold &#8220;outside-the-box&#8221; thinking sessions where nothing is off-limits and wild brainstorming is encouraged. Or it might entail personally and consistently giving honest feedback to your direct reports, and not getting defensive when feedback is being given to you.</p>



<p>Consistent behavior dictates the kind of culture you will have, regardless of how your team changes. When managing a growing team, consciously avoiding unwanted culture creep should absolutely be a primary area of focus for you. Ask yourself: &#8220;How am I counteracting culture creep by committing to consistent behaviors as a leader?&#8221;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Don&#8217;t focus on this: Team building events.</h3>



<p>You&#8217;ve noticed it already: The newer and bigger the team, the more in flux the organization is, the shakier the level of trust that exists. It makes sense: If folks are new to the team and a lot has been changing, it&#8217;s hard to know if you can trust each other.</p>



<p>However, this trust gap won&#8217;t be remedied by holding team social mixers or happy hour game nights. True, long-lasting trust emerges when your team has the experience of working together and relying on each other. Over time, they&#8217;ll observe through consistent action that they can trust you – and each other. This is called &#8220;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0148296303001401">cognitive trust</a>&#8221; by researchers, a powerful form of trust that is based on someone feeling they can count on you. It reveals that trust is not just getting to know each other&#8217;s hobbies or spending time with each other socially – building deep trust is about showing others around you that they can depend on you.</p>



<p>Consider this for yourself as a leader managing a growing team: How can you focus on enabling your team to show that they can rely on each other, so they can deepen their trust in each other? (<a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2020/05/10/virtual-team-building-how-to-build-trust-in-a-remote-team/?utm_source=blog">You can read more about cognitive trust and how to truly build trust in a team in this piece, particularly in remote + hybrid teams, here.</a>) </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img decoding="async" width="300" height="148" src="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/remoteleadership-1024x504-1-300x148.png" alt="Wobbly" class="wp-image-7787"/></figure></div>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Focus on this: Wobbly is okay.</h3>



<p>Things feel wobbly. Unstable. Whiplash. Who was here before no longer is. What was true six months ago is not true today. Your team is wondering, &#8220;Is this chaos&#8230; normal?&#8221; How do you give folks a sense of stability, and not that the ship is sinking or going around in circles?</p>



<p>The meaningful action to take when managing a growing team is to let your team know: Wobbly is okay. The ocean has waves. It&#8217;s normal, and it&#8217;s part of nature. This means saying explicitly to your team: &#8220;This is a period of flux&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;Bear with me during this gray period&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;This may feel like whiplash&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Let it be known, not hidden. Let them know you&#8217;re aware, not oblivious. You&#8217;re sharing in this experience of flux <em>with</em> them. It&#8217;s <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2021/07/01/leadership-anxiety-how-to-lead-when-you-feel-it/?utm_source=blog">rocky and uneasy for you too</a>.</p>



<p>Given that the ocean has waves, it also has periods of times when the waves die down. With time, things will become calmer. Point out for your team when this will happen for your organization. You can say: &#8220;Things are in flux because&#8230;&#8221; and &#8220;Here&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing to create more stability and consistency.&#8221;</p>



<p>Remember that wobbly is okay.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Don&#8217;t focus on this: Perfecting your communication.</h3>



<p>Talk, talk, talk, write, write write. It can seem like all we do as leaders is communicate. Especially during these times of flux and high-growth when many new adjustments are needing to be communicated, it can be easy to feel like the stakes are high to communicate everything <em>perfectly</em>. To use language that is aligned with the company brand. To strike the right balance of both confident yet not tone deaf in your tone.</p>



<p>While finessing your communication as a leader is a desirable behavior, it&#8217;s also impossible to do 100% perfectly when so much is changing so quickly. Instead, cut yourself a break. Examine what is most important to communicate and focus on communicating those things with the most directness, tact, and a tone that is most appropriate. Pick the one message that matters most (i.e., &#8220;Our vision is&#8230;&#8221;) and refine how you&#8217;ll communicate the &#8220;why&#8221; behind it and how it connects what matters to your team members. Don&#8217;t worry as much about if you&#8217;re communicating the smaller changes as pristinely as you are communicating the bigger ones (i.e., &#8220;We&#8217;re changing our healthcare policy&#8221; or &#8220;We&#8217;re having Thursdays be no-meetings across the organization&#8221;).</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity"/>



<p>Of course in an ideal world, you&#8217;d do it all. But that&#8217;s not what focus is.</p>



<p>With as much change and growth that exists in your current context, you must pick and choose in order to be effective.</p>



<p>Start with picking and choosing the items above – saying &#8220;yes&#8221; and &#8220;no&#8221; these behaviors.</p>



<p>In a future piece, I&#8217;ll share write Part 2 for <em>next</em> important actions to focus on as a leader managing a growing team, including how to onboard your team and setting expectations.</p>



<p>But those are for later. They aren&#8217;t most urgent, and pressing when managing a growing team. For now, focus on saying &#8220;yes&#8221; and &#8220;no&#8221; to the things above, first.</p>



<p>The wobbliness of it all will feel steadier, when you do.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-as-a-new-leader-get-your-bearings-with-these-critical-questions-to-ask-when-taking-over-a-new-team">As a new leader, get your bearings with these critical questions to ask when taking over a new team.</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="429" src="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Untitled_Artwork-12-1024x429.png" alt="questions to ask when taking over a new team" class="wp-image-7757"/></figure>



<p>A new leader recently asked me, &#8220;What are the important questions to ask when taking over a new team?&#8221;</p>



<p>His voice revealed simultaneous excitement and nervousness:  His direct supervisor had handed him the reigns to a role he&#8217;d been eager to fulfill – but it was a new team after all, one that he knew nothing about.</p>



<p>Newness and the unknown are inextricably linked. When you&#8217;re new, there are bound to be things you don&#8217;t know. As a new leader, you inherit routines and and ways of doing things you&#8217;re unfamiliar with. You&#8217;re the outsider amidst a group of people who&#8217;ve all worked together for a while.</p>



<p>How are you supposed to navigate and lead a new team given these challenges?</p>



<p>Rather than let anxiety grip you and hastily project a guise of competence –&nbsp;embrace the unknown for what it is, and commit to clarifying it.</p>



<p>Dedicate yourself to figuring out the right questions to ask when taking over a new team. Questions will be your light into dusty corners, unearth helpful insights under long-overturned stones. With the right questions, you&#8217;ll gain both the confidence and context necessary to be successful as a new leader.</p>



<p>Below are the 21 questions to ask when taking over a new team that we&#8217;ve found to be most effective in our research in training over 30,000+ leaders over the past decade-plus here at <a href="https://canopy.is?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=21-questions-to-ask">Canopy</a>.</p>



<p>Ideally, you&#8217;ll want to ask these questions in a 1:1 setting, so you can provide a sense of safety for your team members when they answer and also so you have the opportunity to dive deeper in the follow-up questions, as it makes sense.</p>



<p>Additionally, you do not want to just unload all the questions at once &#8212; there&#8217;s 21 of them after all, which would be overwhelming to ask in one go (and not to mention end up being a 3 hour meeting for the both of you).</p>



<p>Rather, I suggest splitting up the 21 questions <a href="https://canopy.is/m/training_modules/4-how-to-hold-effective-1-1-meetings?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=21-questions-to-ask">across 3 &#8211; 4 distinct one-on-one meetings</a> that each focus on a particular area. Here is how it might look&#8230;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-21-key-questions-to-ask-when-taking-over-a-new-team">The 21 key questions to ask when taking over a new team:</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-first-1-1-meeting-trust-building">The First 1:1 Meeting &#8211; Trust-building</h3>



<p><em>Try these 3 questions to ask when taking over a new team in your first one-on-one meeting:</em></p>



<ul>
<li>What do you tend to find energizing or relaxing for you, outside of work?</li>



<li>Anything fun / exciting you’ve been looking forward to?</li>



<li>Why do you choose to work at X, versus other organizations?</li>
</ul>



<p>Then, I&#8217;d also recommend sharing your own answers to the same questions so there is a bit of reciprocity here, and it doesn&#8217;t feel like a one-sided interrogation <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-second-1-1-meeting-work-preferences-team-dynamics">The Second 1:1 Meeting – Work Preferences &amp; Team Dynamics</h3>



<p><meta charset="utf-8"><em>Try these 7 questions to ask when taking over a new team in your second one-on-one meeting:</em></p>



<ul>
<li>How do you prefer to receive feedback? (Verbal, written, in-person)? How do you prefer to give feedback? (Verbal, written, in-person)?</li>



<li>What do you wish was communicated to you more often?</li>



<li>When have you felt micromanaged? When have you felt like you’ve needed more support?</li>



<li>Who’s the best boss you’ve ever had and why? The worst boss you’ve ever had and why?</li>



<li>What was the best team experience for you? The worst team experience?</li>



<li>How do you like to be shown gratitude?</li>



<li>How often would you like to set up a standing one-on-one or check-in meeting? Every week? Biweekly? Once a month? Once a quarter?</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-third-1-1-meeting-grievances-desired-improvements">The Third 1:1 Meeting– Grievances + Desired Improvements</h3>



<p><meta charset="utf-8"><em>Try these 6 questions to ask when taking over a new team in your third one-on-one meeting:</em></p>



<ul>
<li>What do you want to change in this team?</li>



<li>What do you not want to change in this team?</li>



<li>What’s typically been taboo to talk about in the past? &#8211; What have you been nervous to bring up?</li>



<li>What looming concerns or apprehension might you have?</li>



<li>What’s been the most frustrating thing to have encountered with the team lately?</li>



<li>Where do you see the biggest opportunity for improvement with the team?</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-fourth-1-1-meeting-motivations-aspirations">The Fourth 1:1 Meeting– Motivations + Aspirations</h3>



<p><meta charset="utf-8"><em>Try these 4 questions to ask when taking over a new team in your fourth one-on-one meeting:</em></p>



<ul>
<li>What’s been the most motivating project you’ve worked on all year? With whom? And why?</li>



<li>What excites and energizes you about the company?</li>



<li>What are you most grateful for in being a part of this company?</li>



<li>What do you think has been a big obstacle to progress?</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://canopy.is/m/training_modules/4-how-to-hold-effective-1-1-meetings?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=21-questions-to-ask">Each of these 1:1 meetings should last 30 &#8211; 60 minutes long</a>. While it initially feels like an inordinate about of time spend, the time invested is well worth it. From these twenty-one questions, you&#8217;ll begin to deeply understand each team member&#8217;s working styles, proclivities, and requirements for them to be set-up for success.</p>



<p>The time you spend also signals that you care about learning these things (e.g., their work preferences). And lastly, it sets a precedent for the kind of leader you&#8217;d like to be: One who leads with questions rather than answers, who doesn&#8217;t presume or impose their perspective on others.</p>



<p>Try these 21 questions to ask when taking over a new team – and with it will come your ability to lead well, for things to start off on a strong foot, and for the unknown to slowly dissipate.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Dear customer support specialist who cares about doing meaningful work,</strong></h2>



<p>If your dream is to help people have a positive experience with a solution that truly makes a difference and to do it with a small team that values freedom, sustainability, and ownership, I&#8217;ve got good news for you&#8230; we&#8217;re hiring a Customer Support Specialist at Know Your Team.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-first-a-quick-introduction">First, a quick introduction.</h2>



<p>My name is&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/clairejlew" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Claire Lew</a>, and I&#8217;m the CEO of&nbsp;<a href="https://knowyourteam.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Know Your Team</a>. Our company, Know Your Team, is software that gives you the tools, training, and resources to become a better manager. Thousands of managers at companies like Airbnb, Netflix, Pixar, and Shopify use our software and attend our trainings every single week.</p>



<p>We were born from&nbsp;<a href="https://basecamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Basecamp</a>&nbsp;back in 2014, and have been profitable since Month 1. We&#8217;ve been a 100% remote company for the entire time, and purposefully stayed small in headcount, and avoided traditional VC funding to enable us to stay focused on serving our customers to the highest quality. You can read more about our journey so far&nbsp;<a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/story" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. (We&#8217;re a bit of weird company, admittedly!)</p>



<p><strong>Above all else, what motivates us at KYT is making progress toward our vision</strong>:&nbsp; A world where bad bosses are the exception, not the norm. Imagine a world where leadership doesn&#8217;t have such a high learning curve. A world where anyone, anywhere, can become a better leader – with a little help from us <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>We believe if you help managers become better, everything gets better. An organization with better leadership achieves better outcomes and takes better care of its people. Helping people become better leaders might just be one of the most high-leverage ways to help the world.</p>



<p>For our own company, our vision is for KYT to be an independent, remote, profitable company that&#8217;s small in headcount but impacting tens of thousands (if not hundreds or even millions!) of managers, for 10 years and beyond. We want KYT to be a place where people come to do the best work of their lives – and continue to do the best work of their lives. Sustainability, and lasting in the long-term is a key part of success, for us.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-so-what-s-the-job">So what&#8217;s the job?</h2>



<p><strong>You&#8217;ll be responsible for managing and replying to all incoming customer support inquiries during KYT business hours, Monday through Friday, 8AM &#8211; 5PM PT</strong>&nbsp;across all our channels (Help Scout, Intercom, social media) in an empathetic, friendly way.&nbsp; Right now, it&#8217;s the amazing Jenna Chaplin who is running Customer Support – but her exceptional talents fit better with Customer&nbsp;<em>Success</em>, and so you&#8217;ll have to opportunity to replace her, which we&#8217;ll be genuinely grateful for.</p>



<p><strong>You&#8217;ll take on technical support requests</strong>, triage tasks to our Engineering Team,&nbsp; dive-in to troubleshoot and do QA with the customer, and even directly debug issues in the console. You&#8217;ll acquire deep product knowledge about KYT and problem-solve when customers run into technical issues or confusion about using a certain part of our product.</p>



<p><strong>You&#8217;ll identify the customers who need our help</strong>&nbsp;– the ones who are stuck or don&#8217;t know how to get started – and proactively reach out to them to lend a hand. You&#8217;ll share best practices, offer helpful tips, and give them encouragement on their path to becoming a better manager.</p>



<p><strong>You&#8217;ll be the eyes, ears, and heart of the customer</strong>&nbsp;– sharing insights and desires gleaned from customer interactions with the rest of the KYT so our product and offerings can be better for our managers.</p>



<p><strong>You&#8217;ll own, write, update, and improve all our customer support documentation</strong>, including our Help Docs and internal documentation around customer support.</p>



<p>Over time, as you grow more comfortable with the role and the product, you&#8217;ll run demo tours for prospective and current customers, improve our onboarding flow to enable greater customer success, and strategize + execute cross-functional projects that help improve the overall KYT customer experience.</p>



<p><strong>High-level, here&#8217;s how you can expect to spend your time in a given week:</strong></p>



<ul><li>60% &#8211; Responding to support inquiries, Monday through Friday, 8AM &#8211; 5PM PT.</li><li>20% &#8211; Working with our Product team to do Q/A and monitoring our errors system, raising important issues to our engineers and proactively notifying customers affected.</li><li>10% &#8211; Improving our support documentation + brainstorming/executing ways to improve our overall KYT customer experience.</li><li>10% &#8211; Working on cross-functional projects that align with your skills/interests that support our team, move KYT forward, and improve the overall KYT customer experience.</li></ul>



<p><strong>The full-time salary for this role is $70,000 USD, with health benefits, and unlimited vacation.</strong>&nbsp;We try to do everything in our power to give you the trust, space and stability to do your best work.<strong>&nbsp;<br><br></strong>This is a full-time role. Eventually, we&#8217;ll hire another full-time Customer Support Specialist for you to work alongside. As the company grows, we&#8217;d continue to build a team around you. And if things worked out well, you could potentially grow into a Head of Customer Support role.</p>



<p>Together, we’d grow Know Your Team to be a solution that improves the lives of hundreds of thousands (if not millions!) of managers every day.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-who-i-am-looking-for-exactly">Who I am looking for exactly?</h2>



<p><strong>I&#8217;m looking for an impeccable, clear writer</strong>. Fluent in writing and speaking English is a must. You distill complex concepts into simple phrasing, and get-to-the-point quickly and thoughtfully. You communicate warmth and friendliness in your words. It doesn’t matter what you’ve studied (or if you graduated from school at all): You&#8217;ve honed your craft of writing over the years, in your own way. You believe the best writing is not what you&nbsp;<em>intend</em>&nbsp;to say, but in fact, how it comes across to the other person.</p>



<p><strong>You&#8217;re a problem-solver at heart, who excels in tackling detailed + technical challenges.&nbsp;</strong>To you, there&#8217;s no greater thrill than helping someone else make progress toward an outcome they care about. You consider yourself tech-savvy and innately inquisitive. You relish learning new technologies and new skills, and typically you&#8217;re always tinkering with&nbsp;<em>something</em>. You even might know some basic HTML/CSS (or even basic Ruby) or have used console tools in the past to help run pre-written scripts – but&nbsp;<em>totally</em>&nbsp;fine if not, too! Either way, it&#8217;s highly probable that you&#8217;re &#8220;that one friend&#8221; all your friends go to when they can&#8217;t get their computer to reboot properly or need a recommendation on &#8220;an app for X&#8221;. You are curious and persistent to find a solution and creative in how you approach a problem.</p>



<p><strong>You&#8217;re empathetic (perhaps to a fault, at times!)</strong>. Your day is made when you can make another person smile – be the Amazon delivery guy at your doorstep or your kid&#8217;s school teacher via Zoom. Even when the world feels like it&#8217;s falling apart (oof, does it feel like that more than ever!), you maintain a cheery orientation and choose to see the good in people. In previous work environments, co-workers likely have marveled and how upbeat and calm you remain when others around you feel downtrodden and overwhelmed.</p>



<p><strong>Most importantly, you believe in the vision of Know Your Team.</strong>&nbsp;You’ve personally felt the pain of having a bad manager (or two) before. Or you’ve personally struggled to find an effective learning path to become a better leader, yourself. Either way, you’re passionate about what Know Your Team stands for, and how we can help as many managers become better leaders.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-i-d-love-to-hear-from-you-here-s-how-you-can-apply">I’d love to hear from you. Here&#8217;s how you can apply:</h2>



<p>If you’re interested in working together,&nbsp;<a href="https://apply.workable.com/know-your-team/j/B69B2E4531/apply/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>apply here</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;by 11:59PM PT Thursday, March 24th, 2022&nbsp;</strong>with the following information&#8230;</p>

<p><a href="https://apply.workable.com/know-your-team/j/B69B2E4531/apply/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Please apply here by 11:59PM PT, Thursday, March 24th, 2022</strong></a><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;We&#8217;ll confirm that we&#8217;ve received your application within 48 hours.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-if-you-ve-never-been-a-fan-of-performance-reviews-our-tool-guide-are-for-you">If you&#8217;ve never been a fan of performance reviews, our tool + guide are for you. </h2>



<p>Reviews are for books, movies, and restaurants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reviews are <em>not</em> for people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The concept of “performance reviews” has always felt odd to you, as a result.</p>



<p>As a leader, you want your team to continually level-up and improve – but a “performance review” doesn’t accomplish that. In fact,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/249332/harm-good-truth-performance-reviews.aspx">research</a>&nbsp;has found that traditional performance reviews make performance worse one-third of the time.</p>



<p>This is for 4 reasons:</p>



<p><strong>#1:&nbsp; “I don’t want to say anything bad.”</strong>We fear what we write in our performance reviews might negatively affect ourselves – or someone else. We keep our feedback surface-level and vague, rather than meaningful and specific.</p>



<p><strong>#2: “I&#8217;ll wait to bring this up at the next review cycle.”&nbsp;</strong>We sit on feedback until the performance review cycle happens, enabling feedback to inevitably build up. We surprise our team if and when it does come out in the end – and not in a good way.</p>



<p><strong>#3: “I have to triangulate and summarize 3+ people&#8217;s perspectives.”</strong>Performance reviews are not a direct, frank conversation. They are a telephone game of &#8220;he said she said,&#8221; leaving us confused on what exactly they need to improve. Rarely do performance reviews feel fair or accurate.</p>



<p><strong>#4:&nbsp; “Sheesh, this takes forever.”</strong>The average manager&nbsp;<a href="https://hbr.org/2016/10/the-performance-management-revolution">reported</a>&nbsp;spending about 210 hours on writing performance reviews. 210 hours to describe how project communications could’ve been better, 210 hours to describe how project outcomes could’ve been better… That’s longer than some projects take, themselves!</p>



<p>You’re ready for a better way&#8230;</p>



<p>And it&#8217;s (finally) here!<strong><br></strong></p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Introducing our Performance Review Alternative <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f973.png" alt="🥳" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong></h1>



<p>After spending 2 years studying research from the past 20+ years on performance reviews and collecting our own independent research from 1,000+ managers and employees, we&#8217;ve distilled it all into a&nbsp;<a href="https://reviewsarenotforpeople.com/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=kytblog&amp;utm_campaign=launch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">methodology</a>&nbsp;and a&nbsp;<a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/performance_feedback?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=kytblog&amp;utm_campaign=launch">tool</a>&nbsp;for a performance review alternative.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With performance review season upon us, a frequent question I receive is: &#8220;What questions to ask in a performance review?&#8221;</p>



<p>I won&#8217;t lie. I&#8217;m not a fan of performance reviews (<a href="https://canopy.is/blog/2021/11/11/how-to-give-better-employee-performance-reviews-dont/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=5-performance-review-questions">you can read why here</a>).</p>



<p>But sometimes, as leaders, it&#8217;s out of our hands: We&#8217;re a part of a company that&#8217;s leaned on performance reviews for a while. Or perhaps we&#8217;re reluctant adopters and use performance reviews because we haven&#8217;t yet discovered a better alternative.</p>



<p>I hear you. And I want to help.</p>



<p>To make the most of the performance reviews you&#8217;re <em>already</em> doing,&nbsp;here are the most meaningful questions to ask in a performance review as a leader – for yourself, and from your team.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-as-a-leader-ask-these-questions">As a leader, ask these questions&#8230;</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-what-should-i-start-stop-or-continue-doing">#1: What should I start, stop, or continue doing?</h3>



<p>This is a classic question for good reason. I call it a &#8220;catch-all&#8221; question:  It opens up <em>many areas</em> for people to share feedback with you without resorting to a generic question such as &#8220;What should I improve?&#8221;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-what-can-i-improve-about-my-communication-in-terms-of-both-content-e-g-priorities-decisons-etc-and-style-e-g-tone-frequency-etc">#2: What can I improve about my communication, in terms of both content (e.g., priorities, decisons, etc.) and style (e.g., tone, frequency, etc.)?</h3>



<p>Communication is the crux of what we do as leaders. And so, it&#8217;s paramount that we ask for feedback on it, and include it as one of the questions to ask in a performance review. This question is excellent at zooming in on the two aspects of communication you&#8217;ll want feedback on as a leader: (1) <em>What</em> you&#8217;re communicating, and (2) <em>How</em> you&#8217;re communicating those things.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-what-more-can-i-be-doing-to-help-you-navigate-uncertainty">#3: What more can I be doing to help you navigate uncertainty?</h3>



<p>Oftentimes, performance reviews will include questions such as <em>&#8220;Am I giving you enough direction?</em>&#8221; or <em>&#8220;How well do I set our goals?&#8221;</em>&#8230; But what we <em>really</em> should be asking about is the underlying reason for why we need direction and goals in the first place: To navigate uncertainty in order for us to make progress. We as leaders are &#8220;<a href="https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/sensemaking-in-organizations/book4988">sense makers</a>,&#8221; as described by scholar Karl Weick, and we should ask a question on this in our feedback process – be it performance reviews or an <a href="https://canopy.is/m/rethinking-performance-reviews?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=5-performance-review-questions">alternative system</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-how-well-have-i-been-following-through-on-the-things-i-ve-promised">#4: How well have I been following through on the things I&#8217;ve promised?</h3>



<p>Following through on our commitments as leaders is one of the <a href="https://canopy.is/blog/2019/02/12/the-3-most-effective-ways-to-build-trust-as-a-leader/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=5-performance-review-questions">top ways for us to build trust in our teams</a>. Thus, it&#8217;s critical that one of the questions to ask in a performance review encompasses this concept. Use this question as a barometer for how well you&#8217;ve established cognitive trust – not just relational trust – so you understand how much your team feels they can depend on you.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-what-are-the-things-i-ve-done-that-were-particularly-helpful-or-unhelpful">#5: What are the things I&#8217;ve done that were particularly helpful or unhelpful?</h3>



<p>This question can be particularly powerful due to its framing of &#8220;helpfulness.&#8221;  When we ask for &#8220;what was helpful vs. unhelpful,&#8221; we focus on the <em>value of the action</em>, rather than the implied judgment of the person who took that action. As a result, it coaxes someone to share feedback that they might&#8217;ve been originally more reluctant to give.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity"/>



<p>Ideally, as a leader, these are questions you are asking not just once or twice a year during performance reviews –&nbsp;but consistently and regularly, so you can be constantly improving your own performance.</p>



<p>Now, for your direct reports, you may be wondering what questions to ask in a performance review for them? Here are our recommendations below.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-have-your-direct-reports-ask-you-these-questions">Have your direct reports ask <em>you</em> these questions&#8230;</h2>



<ul>
<li>What should I start, stop, or continue doing? </li>



<li>How is the quality of my work output? Any observations for what I could be doing better?</li>



<li><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif;">What&#8217;s something affecting our work dynamic and ability to get great work done? </span></li>



<li>To what degree do you think am I focused on the right things in my role?</li>



<li>What advice might you share with me to help me level up and further improve my work?</li>
</ul>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="442" src="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/performance-reviews.png" alt="how to give better employee performance reviews" class="wp-image-7502"/></figure>



<p>&#8220;How to give better employee performance reviews?&#8221;</p>



<p>This is a question I&#8217;ve consistently received over the years, and becomes more pronounced as we enter performance review season.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a <em>particularly</em> salient question given that, from our August 2020 survey of 1,087 managers and employees, 86% said they hold performance reviews – but only 23% of those people said they were &#8220;satisfied&#8221; with their performance review process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In short:&nbsp; 86% of us are doing something that only 23% of us like.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">It&#8217;s worse than you think.</h2>



<p>Not only are a majority of us implementing a process that we&#8217;re not satisfied with, but the&nbsp;<em>utility</em> of the process itself is dubious: &nbsp;</p>



<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mercer.com/our-thinking/career/performance-transformation-in-the-future-of-work.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2019 study by Mercer</a>&nbsp;found that only 2% of companies believe feel their performance process delivers exceptional value. In fact, Gallup&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/249332/https//www.gallup.com/products/220448/leading-high-performance-teams-course.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared</a>&nbsp;how &#8220;traditional performance reviews and approaches to feedback are often so bad that they actually make performance worse about one-third of the time.&#8221; They further discovered that &#8220;only 14% of employees strongly agree their performance reviews inspire them to improve.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yet, we still do performance reviews.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We do them even though we feel like we&#8217;re twisting people&#8217;s arms to complete them. We do them even though we dread filling them out, ourselves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How did we get here? And, most importantly:&nbsp; Is there a better way?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-long-and-winding-road">A long and winding road.</h2>



<p>How did we get here? </p>



<p><a href="https://hbr.org/2016/10/the-performance-management-revolution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Around World War I</a>, performance reviews were first introduced as a rating system to help the U.S. military identify and dismiss poor performers. It was a tool to help with succession planning that was not shared with the soldiers and officers being evaluated. The original intention of performance reviews was to help the&nbsp;<em>organization</em>&nbsp;– not to help the&nbsp;<em>individuals</em>&nbsp;themselves grow.</p>



<p>Fast forward to the present and our thinking has changed. Today, many companies want their performance reviews to be a tool used to give feedback and to an employee, so they can know how they can get better. In our survey with  1,087 managers and employees,&nbsp;we found&nbsp;<strong>70% believed the primary purpose of reviews in an organization is to help a team member develop.</strong></p>



<p>However, traditional performance reviews are oftentimes simultaneously used to determine promotion, compensation, and raises. Other companies use them as a tool used for legal protection and to justify future firings.</p>



<p>No wonder we can&#8217;t quite seem to have performance reviews that feel good or are useful:&nbsp; It&#8217;s unclear for many organizations what the original purpose of the performance review – let alone what we should try to optimize for – is in the first place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a result, we&#8217;re left with a system with gaping problems when we think about how to give better employee performance reviews. Here&#8217;s what those exact problems of performance reviews are.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-broken-process-with-6-distinct-problems">A broken process, with 6 distinct problems.</h2>



<p>Here are the primary problems of performance reviews&#8230;</p>



<p><strong>&#8220;So, what&#8217;s this really for?&#8221;</strong><br>Performance reviews try to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/249332/https//www.gallup.com/products/220448/leading-high-performance-teams-course.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">do too many things at once</a>. Many teams will use performance reviews to do some mix of the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>offering advice on how to improve</li>



<li>setting an employee&#8217;s bonus or raise</li>



<li>deciding on a promotion</li>



<li>justifying a future firing</li>
</ul>



<p>Unfortunately, this diluted focus leads to the performance review not being able to do&nbsp;<em>any</em>&nbsp;of these things well.</p>



<p><strong>&#8220;Are you judging me, or coaching me?&#8221;&nbsp;</strong><br>Most performance reviews are tied to compensation and/or ratings. In our survey, we found that 63% of 1,087 people surveyed said that their performance reviews were tied to compensation. While popular, this backfires. This means the minute you try to offer feedback during a review, the person on the other side is bracing themselves for whether they got a raise or got promoted&#8230; not, &#8220;Oh is this feedback I should internalize in some way.&#8221; In fact,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.strategy-business.com/article/00275?gko=c442b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studies</a>&nbsp;show how rankings trigger a fight-or-flight response in the brain. When performance reviews conflate growth with judgment, it damages the likelihood of growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>&#8220;I wish I would&#8217;ve known this earlier.&#8221;&nbsp;<br></strong>Performance reviews are a one-time instance. This means the feedback that&#8217;s given is imprecise and/or too late to truly matter, as it&#8217;s been built up over the past year. Or, the feedback has been completely absent and hits the other person like water from a firehose: In fact,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/straight-talk-about-employee-evaluation-and-performance-management" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many organizations</a>, it&#8217;s &#8220;the only time where they can force managers to give feedback.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>&#8220;I have no idea what to do with this.&#8221;&nbsp;<br></strong>Poor delivery by the manager and/or the organization often lead to botched performance reviews. Managers haven&#8217;t been trained to give effective feedback. HR managers&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mercer.com/our-thinking/career/performance-transformation-in-the-future-of-work.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">believe</a>&nbsp;8 in 10 managers have skill gaps in giving feedback and coaching, and only 14.5% of managers&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/267251/why-employees-fed-feedback.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strongly agree</a>&nbsp;that they are effective at giving feedback.</p>



<p><strong>&#8220;Where is this coming from?&#8221;&nbsp;<br></strong>There are few worse feelings than the feeling of injustice. That you&#8217;re being wronged. Performance reviews conjure this for many people:&nbsp; According to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236135/give-performance-reviews-actually-inspire-employees.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gallup</a>, only 29% of employees strongly agree that the performance reviews they receive are fair, and 26% strongly agree that they are accurate. This is there is complete opacity in where this feedback is coming from (44% of performance reviews are anonymous in some way), and the review is delivered in a singular direction rather than having a multidirectional conversation (52% of people participate in manager-to-direct-report reviews only). In the end, it&#8217;s awfully frustrating.</p>



<p><strong>&#8220;Sheesh, this takes forever.&#8221;</strong><br>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://hbr.org/2016/10/the-performance-management-revolution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>&nbsp;by the advisory service CEB, the average manager reported spending about 210 hours — which is close to five weeks of doing performance reviews per year. In our survey, most people reported that their performance review takes more than two weeks to implement, with 66% of managers spending 4 hours or more to complete them – with 13% spending 12+ hours. That&#8217;s longer than some projects, themselves. One could only wonder how much energy could be directed toward the work itself with that amount of sheer effort and time.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-attempts-at-rethinking-performance-reviews">Attempts at rethinking performance reviews.</h2>



<p>As a result, many companies sought to reinvent the performance review. GE, Adobe, GAP are just some of the companies that have transitioned away from traditional performance reviews to figure out how to give better employee performance reviews.</p>



<p>What have they moved toward?&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Frequent one-on-one conversations between managers and direct reports.</strong> At <a href="https://qz.com/428813/ge-performance-review-strategy-shift/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GE</a>, these are called &#8220;touchpoints&#8221; that focus on two questions: What should I keep doing, and what should I change? At <a href="https://www.adobe.com/check-in.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Adobe</a>, managers hold quarterly &#8220;Check-ins,&#8221; that are forward-focused conversations. At <a href="https://www.rebelplaybook.com/bonus-plays/ditching-performance-ratings-and-annual-reviews-gap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gap</a>, they call their system &#8220;GPS&#8221; – &#8220;Grow. Perform. Succeed.” It encourages 12 informal conversations throughout the year that focus on three questions: <em>What went well? Where did you get stuck? What would you do differently next time?</em></li>



<li><strong>Ongoing, real-time requests for feedback by anyone</strong>. GE, IBM, and Amazon all <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/10/the-performance-management-revolution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have</a> internal apps each company has developed they use to both invite and give feedback to peers – even outside their team or division.</li>



<li><strong>Removal of stack rankings or ratings. </strong>Many companies, including GE and Adobe, have completely eliminated any kind of numerical ranking or ratings from their performance review process.</li>



<li><strong>Compensation determined by a separate process. </strong>A compensation and promotion discussion is often held separate from these coaching conversations. At <a href="https://www.rebelplaybook.com/bonus-plays/ditching-performance-ratings-and-annual-reviews-gap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gap</a>, these conversations are held once a year, and managers are given a detailed model to match compensation with performance. Similarly, at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Work-Rules-Insights-Inside-Transform/dp/1455554790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google</a>, these conversations are separated by a month: In November, a conversation about performance is held, and in December, a conversation about compensation and role changes is held. At <a href="https://hbr.org/2014/01/how-netflix-reinvented-hr">Netflix</a>, they take a completely different approach: Compensation is purely dictated by the market rate, with Netflix paying its staff always top of market instead of allocating bonuses.</li>
</ul>



<p>Results of moving away from traditional performance reviews have been positive for some companies:&nbsp; Adobe&nbsp;<a href="https://www.adobe.com/check-in/discover.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>&nbsp;a 10% increase in the number who say they receive ongoing feedback that helps their performance, and Cargill&nbsp;<a href="https://www.strategy-business.com/article/00275?gko=586a5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">found</a>&nbsp;&#8220;overall, 90 percent of the no-rating pilot participants reported, year after year, that their experience was positive.&#8221;</p>



<p>However,&nbsp;<strong>outcomes are not entirely uniform nor conclusive across the board.</strong>&nbsp;Some companies have tried taking steps to revamp their performance review – only to resort to reinstating them a year two later. Other companies have chosen to retain certain elements of their traditional performance reviews.</p>



<p>Why is this? Are there certain elements of traditional performance reviews that some companies still find valuable?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-not-throwing-the-baby-out-with-the-bath-water">Not throwing the baby out with the bath water.</h2>



<p>Some companies, like Facebook, are holding on to a version of the performance review that incorporates ratings and tie it to compensation.&nbsp;<strong>Facebook in particular found in a&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://hbr.org/2016/11/lets-not-kill-performance-evaluations-yet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>survey</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;with 300 members of their own staff that 87% of employees wanted to keep performance reviews.</strong>&nbsp;(Facebook&#8217;s performance reviews include peer reviews that are delivered by managers that denote a certain rating and are a part of a compensation discussion – with a formula used subsequently to determine that compensation.)</p>



<p>Similarly, companies such as PwC and Deloitte, have maintained parts of their performance reviews as a way for how to give better employee performance reviews:&nbsp; PwC&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40405106/ready-to-scrap-your-annual-performance-reviews-try-these-alternatives" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gives</a>&nbsp;ratings to their employees across five competencies, while other companies like Deloitte&nbsp;<a href="https://hbr.org/2015/04/reinventing-performance-management" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">assign</a>&nbsp;them one of four categories that provide a &#8220;performance snapshot.&#8221; &nbsp;</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s why some companies retain all or certain elements of performance reviews for the following reasons&#8230;</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Quality of manager conversations can go down in the absence of ratings and/or formal performance reviews.</strong> <a href="https://emtemp.gcom.cloud/ngw/globalassets/en/human-resources/documents/trends/eliminate-performance-ratings.pdf">Research</a> performed by CEB with almost 10,000 managers revealed how the lack of ratings in performance reviews reduced employees&#8217; perceptions of manager conversation quality by 14%. That is, without ratings, managers struggled to tell employees exactly how they could be performing better. <strong>This shows that eliminating ratings doesn&#8217;t solve everything: You have to still equip managers to communicate cogently and clearly feedback to their direct reports.</strong></li>



<li><strong>People want to know where they stand.</strong> One <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02183.x">study</a> shows how uncertainty can trigger intense neural reactions, particularly in highly anxious people. Not knowing if you&#8217;re doing well or poorly can interfere with strong performance. However, <strong>this clarity of how well someone is doing is something that absolutely a manager should be communicating in their one-to-one conversations. </strong>Ratings merely serve as a proxy for a clear message – they are not a requirement for one. For instance, Netflix helps their staff understand where they stand without a numerical or categorical ranking by encouraging their staff to ask the question, &#8220;Would you fight for me if I were to think about leaving?&#8221; They call it the &#8220;Keeper Test.&#8221;</li>



<li><strong>Bias happens when a feedback prompt is too open-ended – or training/support is not provided.</strong> Many <a href="https://ecastill.scripts.mit.edu:444/docs/Gender,%20Race,%20and%20Meritocracy%20%28Castilla%20AJS%20May%202008%29.pdf">studies </a>show how &#8220;without structure, people are more likely to rely on gender, race, and other stereotypes when making decisions.&#8221; Idiosyncratic rater effect is perhaps the most pernicious and widespread of biases in performance reviews: <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/02/most-hr-data-is-bad-data">Studies</a> have famously revealed that 61% of the feedback you give is a reflection of <em>you</em>, as the rater, rather than the other person. As a result, some companies find that having more structure (i.e., ratings) to prevent bias. But the effectiveness of this has been <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/01/why-most-performance-evaluations-are-biased-and-how-to-fix-them">debated</a>, as bias appears even when ratings are present. <strong>To alleviate bias doesn&#8217;t mean we must resort to ratings or re-adopt the formal performance reviews. Rather, it shows how structure and training are necessary around (1) how to give feedback constructively (2) the perils of bias in feedback and how to minimize it.</strong> For example, better prompts for feedback, training around framing feedback more objectively, and reading through the feedback for consistency can help for how to give better employee performance reviews.</li>
</ul>



<p>Whew, this is a lot of information. Clearly, there are trade-offs to weigh and scenarios to consider when thinking if and how to do performance reviews in your company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, if there is one, most meaningful insight to zoom in on, amidst all the noise, it is this…</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-reorienting-around-what-matters-the-interaction">Reorienting around what matters: The Interaction.</h2>



<p>When we try to imagine how to give better employee performance reviews, we&#8217;ve become too fixated on the process – how often the cycles should be, how many people should review each other, how many core competencies to evaluate, which tool to use, if the questions should be drop-down or radio buttons – rather than focusing on the core interaction between team members.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The interaction matters most.</strong> At the end of the day, the most important outcome of the performance review is that it helps your team work better together.&nbsp; As organizational theorist Edgar Schein <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Helping-Offer-Give-Receive-Help/dp/1605098566">defined</a>, teamwork is the development and maintenance of helping relationships amongst all members of the group. In short, positive interactions facilitate better teamwork.</p>



<p>A helpful interaction is one where your team member is willing to tell you, to your face, objectively and kindly what could be better and how you can improve. It&#8217;s an exchange of feedback where the suggestion is received in a non-defensive way, where the person chooses for themselves the actions to take to change their behavior in the future. These helpful interactions should occur at all levels in an organization, and as frequently as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Focus on the interaction – the connection, dialogue, and information and delivery of that information between peer to peer – and everything else about the performance review becomes dressing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a result, as leaders our focus should not be on answering, &#8220;What should our performance review process be?&#8221; or &#8220;How to give better employee performance reviews?&#8221; but rather:</p>



<p><strong><em>&#8220;What is required in the environment to increase the likelihood of helpful interactions?&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<p>Here&#8217;s the answer:</p>



<p><strong>(1) Safety supports success.</strong>&nbsp;Much has been written about Amy Edmondson&#8217;s famed&nbsp;<a href="https://hbr.org/2017/08/high-performing-teams-need-psychological-safety-heres-how-to-create-it" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research</a>&nbsp;on psychological safety being the most important aspect that high-performing teams have in common. That is, you have to create a foundation of trust that makes it safe to speak up and have helpful interactions, in the first place. This includes being vulnerable about needing feedback in the first place, appreciating the feedback you&#8217;re receiving publicly, and employing what&nbsp; Daniel Coyle <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Culture-Code-Secrets-Highly-Successful/dp/0525492461">writes</a> in his book, &#8220;The Culture Code&#8221; of &#8220;belonging cues&#8221; such as eye contact, body language to create this sense of safe connection.</p>



<p><strong>(2) Invite, don&#8217;t impose.</strong>&nbsp;Only 26% of feedback is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/271184/effective-feedback-kind-ask.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">found</a>&nbsp;to be valuable by employees – and a large determinant of this is because the feedback is imposed, rather than invited. Encourage your team members to ask for feedback, as there&#8217;s a higher likelihood that the feedback will be internalized.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>(3) High-frequency routines.&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-74946-9_17" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Research</a>&nbsp;supports that delays in feedback hurt performance and learning, especially around course correction. The more you can give feedback closer to the moment it happened, the more likely it will positively change behavior. At the same time, it can be hard to carve out the time to give live feedback in the day-to-day rush of work – and it can also feel unnatural and stilted. As a result, creating high-frequency routines – a time and place to give and receive this feedback that is structured and well-supported – at minimum once every two weeks is critical.</p>



<p><strong>(4) Multidirectional, not unilateral.&nbsp;</strong>The interaction cannot be an opportunity for growth and improvement if it is one-sided. As a result, feedback should&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;just be collected and aggregated by managers only and direct reports, but enabled peer-to-peer. A huge reason that managers get caught in a tight place with performance reviews is that they have to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.estherderby.com/no-more-middleman-avoid-triangulated-feedback/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">triangulate</a>&nbsp;feedback from one team member to another&#8230; and get caught in the middle. Instead, offer your team ways to provide peer-to-peer feedback, and equip everyone – not just your managers – with the tools and training to give and receive this feedback well.</p>



<p><strong><strong>(5) Practical training.</strong> </strong>For many teams, this is the biggest missing piece: Training that helps team members give actionable, objective feedback, and receive feedback in a productive way. As cited earlier, only 14.5% of managers <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/267251/why-employees-fed-feedback.aspx">strongly agree</a> that they are effective at giving feedback. But it&#8217;s more than just watching a video course on feedback and calling it a day – it&#8217;s giving your team tactical scripts and templates they can use for giving and receiving feedback, and scenarios they can practice.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-theory-to-practice">From theory to practice.</h2>



<p>Here&#8217;s how to implement these principles into action:</p>



<p><strong>(1) Commit to the interaction.</strong>&nbsp;Not a tool, not a process, but to better the interaction between team members. This likely means you will need to:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ensure that your performance review process is about performance feedback, rather than succession planning. In short, it&#8217;s about growth, not judgment. You can build in a succession planning model and compensation model and promotion on top of this. But the interaction is the most important thing to get right, first.</li>



<li>Establish a separate discussion/system from performance feedback. See the Footnote [1] for how other companies do this. </li>
</ul>



<p><strong>(2) Call an all-team meeting together to talk about this renewed commitment + focus on feedback.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Use this meeting to build trust and get people feeling comfortable being vulnerable.</li>



<li>Ask: &#8220;What&#8217;s the most challenging piece of feedback you&#8217;ve ever received in your career and and why?&#8221;</li>



<li>Follow up by writing out why focusing on feedback is so important to your team.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>(3) Give training + resources on how to best give and receive feedback.</strong></p>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>(4) Nudge your team to actively <em>invite</em> feedback – rather than waiting for folks to give it to them.</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>This can be implemented as an email that you manually send to your team, or a weekly or biweekly Slack prompt you share with your team.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>(5) Hold 1:1 meetings every 4 or 6 weeks that are exclusively focused on performance feedback.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Here are examples of what the agenda could say:</p>



<p><em>Personal connection (~10 minutes)&nbsp;</em></p>



<ul>
<li><em>How is your energy level these days?</em></li>
</ul>



<p><em>Performance feedback (~40 minutes)</em></p>



<ul>
<li><em>When we last chatted ____ was an improvement area for me. How do you think I’ve been progressing in that area?</em></li>



<li><em>What about my management style can I improve? </em></li>



<li><em>What aspect of my job do you think I can do better? </em></li>



<li><em>Would you be open to me sharing some performance feedback and opportunities for growth for you?</em></li>



<li><em>Do you mind me sharing a few small observations on what I think could be better?</em></li>
</ul>



<p><em>Takeaways / next steps (~10 minutes)</em></p>



<p><strong>(5) Give monthly shout-outs for the feedback that has been most helpful.</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Every month, you’ll want to appreciate folks for the feedback that they’re sharing. This is a powerful way to indicate that feedback is not only welcomed, but it is thoughtfully considered, and acted on when appropriate. The more you can appreciate the feedback publicly, the more you encourage your team to continue to share feedback. </li>



<li>Share a shout-out about feedback you’ve received at your monthly all-hands meeting. </li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In sum</strong></h2>



<p>Our recommendation for how to give better employee performance reviews is to reorient the performance review to be centered on the one thing that makes a difference:  The interaction.</p>



<p><strong>The process, all together, looks like this:</strong></p>



<ol>
<li>Focus on the interaction.</li>



<li>Remove compensation from feedback.</li>



<li>Establish safety in the environment.</li>



<li>Provide training on giving and receiving feedback.</li>



<li>Prompt ongoing invitations for feedback.</li>



<li>Hold monthly performance-feedback focused 1:1 meetings.</li>



<li>Share monthly feedback shout-outs.</li>
</ol>



<p>With this methodology + tool, our hope is that there will be&#8230;</p>



<p>No more, &#8220;I had no idea&#8230;&#8221; Feedback will be timely, and not a surprise. Feedback is actionable and precise,&nbsp;rather than a vague, arbitrarily assigned scale of &#8220;meets expectations, etc&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>No more he-said-she-said. Feedback comes directly from the source, not weirdly accumulated and triangulated in a black box way.</p>



<p>No more huge time suck. Some 10-week process that only leaves you with a vague sense of what you could be doing better – but nothing specific.</p>



<p>A process that helps your team do the one thing you want it to:&nbsp; Work better together.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="418" src="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/hybrid-work-environment.jpg" alt="hybrid working environment" class="wp-image-7415"/></figure>



<p>Welcome to a new world:  The hybrid working environment is the new norm for many of us. And, its challenges are new to us, as well.</p>



<p>You&#8217;re concerned. Now that your team is transitioning to a hybrid working environment – split between some folks coming into the office regularly, and some folks rarely (or never) coming in – you&#8217;re concerned about the effect this might have on employee morale and culture.</p>



<p>Your concern is warranted. Culture, after all, often models itself after the environment. With two team environments –&nbsp;one remote, one in-person – two team cultures could easily emerge.</p>



<p>The fragmentation might feel innocuous at first, but it&#8217;s disastrous in the long run. Without any malintent, social events could disproportionately happen in person – with no equivalent or attention given to remote workers. More and more meetings that &#8220;just spontaneously needed to happen&#8221; might materialize in person – with folks who are remote aren&#8217;t looped in. A decision could easily be made and announced in the office – but not reach remote folks until a month later.</p>



<p>Over time, the potential for remote employees to start to feel they&#8217;re working at a completely different company than their co-located coworkers is real. In the worst-case scenario, remote employees could feel they are second-class citizens in a hybrid working environment.</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t despair. The cultural crumbling of a hybrid working environment is <em>not</em> inevitable. It can be counteracted.</p>



<p>Here are 4 foundational practices to keep in mind to enable a positive team culture to flourish in your hybrid working environment.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1:-commit-to-being-remote-first,-even-if-you're-hybrid.">#1: Commit to being remote-first, even if you&#8217;re hybrid.</h2>



<p>The biggest pitfall of a hybrid working environment is when your organizational practices are not cohesive. Imagine what happens when a team member is confused about where to find answers to the most fundamental, team-oriented questions. For example: &#8220;If I have a new idea, how/where do I share that with my team?&#8221; or &#8220;If I have a question for someone not on my direct team, exactly how do I go about asking it?&#8221;</p>



<p>If you don&#8217;t have a unifying framework for how to get work done, the work simply won&#8217;t get done well.</p>



<p>Practically speaking, this means committing to a remote-first framework. All communications and collaboration should happen in your team as though 100% of your team is remote. With remote communication and collaboration as the default, everyone then has the ability to opt into meetings, decisions and information can easily be shared, and the most basic questions around how to work are easily and swiftly answered.</p>



<p><strong>If you&#8217;re wondering what a remote-first communications framework looks like in detail, you can reference these resources:</strong></p>



<ul id="draft_check_box_list_0"><li><a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2020/11/17/5-communication-best-practices-for-remote-teams/">5 communication practices for remote teams</a></li><li><a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2019/08/22/how-to-collaborate-effectively-in-a-remote-team/">How to collaborate effectively in a remote team</a></li><li><a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/lessons/161-managing-remote-teams/topics/1301-intro-managing-remote-teams">Guide to Managing Remote Teams</a></li></ul>



<p>Without this cohesion of communication and collaboration, your hybrid work environment is bound to culturally suffer.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="2:-make-the-office-the-new-off-site.">#2: Make the office the new offsite.</h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/culture-in-the-hybrid-workplace">discussion</a> amongst what partners at McKinsey observing in hybrid work environments, one of them remarked:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>&#8220;Some of my clients say the office is the new off-site—the place you get together to collaborate and think forward.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>



<p>This resonates. Off-sites are critical opportunities to brainstorm new ideas, collaborate across functions, and of course, bond and build trust with one another other. (Here at Know Your Team, we are eagerly planning our own annual off-site in 2022, knowing how important off-sites are!)</p>



<p>An equivalence exists for a hybrid working environment. With the office, you have an opportunity to be intentional and purposeful about how you use that space and time together, similar to an off-site. <strong>Consider: For your team, in what ways does &#8220;going into the office&#8221; mean something rather than just &#8220;showing face&#8221;?</strong></p>



<p>Here are a few examples:</p>



<ul id="draft_check_box_list_1"><li>Assign one day a month in the office to be &#8220;cross-collaboration&#8221; days, where everyone comes in and pairs up with someone who they don&#8217;t typically work with, and gets to work next to them for the whole day.</li><li>Delegate one in-person meeting a week that is solely focused on generating out-of-the-box, innovative ideas.</li><li>Ask your team to come into the office every month specifically for an in-person team building event (e.g., this could be something as simple and straightforward as lunch together, or a coffee chat).</li></ul>



<p>The exact meeting or group activity you choose is not particularly consequential. What matters is the <em>purposefulness</em> behind how you structure that time for people when they do come into the office.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="3:-give-opportunities-for-people-to-connect-outside-of-their-direct-department.">#3: Give opportunities to connect outside people&#8217;s direct departments.</h2>



<p>Our world has become narrower. In a <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/02/research-were-losing-touch-with-our-networks">study</a> shared by Harvard Business Review, &#8220;exchanges between close collaborators increased by 40% post-lockdown at the expense of 10% less communication between more distant colleagues.&#8221;  In a hybrid working environment, this is only heightened. The walls of our silos have increased, causing the risk of a fractured, disjointed culture to emerge.</p>



<p>To help our hybrid working environments retain a sense of unity and cohesiveness, we&#8217;ll want to focus on connection points between colleagues in all areas of the organizations, and not just in some.</p>



<p><strong>This means that if you have online coffee chats, make sure that they span across functions, and not always just between remote and co-located folks.</strong></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="4:-open-up-channels-of-feedback-–-especially-1:1-–-to-understand-true-vs.-polished-feedback.">#4: Open up channels for real, unpolished feedback.</h2>



<p>As you transition to a hybrid working environment, you&#8217;re naturally want to know: &#8220;What do people think of this?&#8221;</p>



<p>Perhaps you send a survey, or you ask for feedback during a town hall meeting. But how do you ensure you&#8217;re getting honest, authentic feedback, rather than an edited, polished response?</p>



<p>Even if you do ask folks in a pulse survey, &#8220;On a scale of 1 to 5, how would you rate being in a hybrid working environment?&#8221;&#8230; What does it really mean people tell you, &#8220;Oh, 4&#8221;?</p>



<p>Ultimately, you need to create space for real, candid conversations to be had between you and your team. What does your team <em>really</em> think about working in a hybrid environment? What would like to see changed and/or improved?</p>



<p>The most effective (and also admittedly time-consuming!) way to do this is to have a good old-fashioned 1:1 conversation with each of your direct reports. This way, you can ask specific questions, follow up to clarify and better understand what the person is thinking, and model positive body language and gratitude for them sharing an honest opinion with you.</p>



<p><strong>Here are a few examples of one-on-one meeting questions you could ask to each of your direct reports to collect feedback about your hybrid working environment:</strong></p>



<ul id="draft_check_box_list_2"><li><em>What&#8217;s been the biggest gap between what we&nbsp;*said*&nbsp;was going to be true for how we work as a team, and the *reality* of&nbsp;actually&nbsp;how we work as a team in a hybrid work environment?</em></li><li><em>What have you noticed being annoying or frustrating, now that we&#8217;re in a hybrid remote environment?</em></li><li><em>Do you feel you have all the tools, context, and support to do your best work, in this new work environment?</em></li></ul>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity"/>



<p>A hybrid working environment can enable a healthy culture with concerted effort and focus.</p>



<p>Yes, we&#8217;re a new world with hybrid work. But we can confidently face and address the challenges of it here, starting with these 4 practices.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="418" src="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/team-accountability.jpg" alt="How to hold employees accountable without micromanaging them" class="wp-image-7377"/></figure>



<p>If you&#8217;re a leader who wants the best outcomes, the natural question to ask is:&nbsp; “How to hold employees accountable without micromanaging them?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, this question can feel complicated.</p>



<p>As much as you want your team to be more accountable, you’ve never been eager to play &#8220;bad cop.&#8221; The last thing you want to do is become &#8220;<em>that</em> <a href="https://canopy.is/blog/2019/05/01/am-i-micromanaging-my-team/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=accountable-wo-micromanaging">micromanager</a>,&#8221; getting people&#8217;s nerves by checking in with people incessantly and scrupulously enforcing deadlines. After all, when did the role of a <a href="https://canopy.is/blog/2019/11/12/7-leadership-lessons/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=accountable-wo-micromanaging">leader</a> become the role of a taskmaster?</p>



<p>Simultaneously, you feel the swirl of work –&nbsp;the pace, the volume of it – consuming you and your team. You wonder if you even have another option than to <em>become</em> &#8220;that micromanager.&#8221; Someone makes a mistake. Someone misses a deadline&#8230; Those incidents aren&#8217;t going to cut it if you&#8217;re going to get to where you want to go as a team. Though you don&#8217;t relish in the role, how else are you supposed to keep your team accountable without cracking the proverbial whip?</p>



<p>Another option does exist. It <em>is</em> possible to keep your team accountable without micromanaging them&nbsp;– and with no proverbial whips cracked <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>How, exactly? Here are some practices for how to hold employees without micromanaging them…</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-9-practices-for-how-to-hold-employees-accountable-without-micromanaging-them">9 practices for how to hold employees accountable without micromanaging them.</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-do-not-perpetuate-interruption-cycle">DO NOT:&nbsp; Perpetuate interruption cycle.</h3>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the status on this?&#8221; </p>



<p>It feels like a harmless question. And hey, as a leader, you need to know!</p>



<p>However, lighting up the @Mentions in Slack or overloading the email inbox only annoys – it doesn’t motivate. You can only imagine the feeling of dread you instigate when every single touchpoint of communication you have with a team is:&nbsp; “What’s the status on this?”</p>



<p>Not only is it burdensome, but it also wrecks productivity. Every time you ask for a status update from your team, you interrupt the flow of work. Countless times have I had employees begrudgingly confide in me: &#8220;<em>I spend more time preparing and writing status reports to my boss than doing the work itself.</em>&#8221; Ouch. Could this likely be the case for your own team?</p>



<p>In short:  Every time you send &#8220;What&#8217;s the status on this?&#8221; at random times and expect an immediate response, you perpetuate a cycle of interruption that throws a wrench into productivity and reduces <a href="https://canopy.is/blog/2020/10/29/how-to-build-team-morale-remotely/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=accountable-wo-micromanaging">team morale</a>. </p>



<p>Instead of encouraging this rampant cycle of interruption, know that you can hit PAUSE before sending the &#8220;What&#8217;s the status on X?&#8221; ping, and do this instead&#8230;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-do-ask-and-answer-the-question-how-will-we-know-we-will-have-been-successful">DO:&nbsp; Ask and answer the question:&nbsp; “How will we know we will have been successful?” &nbsp;</h3>



<p>It feels obvious:&nbsp; As leaders, we should establish what “success” looks like, from the start and circle back to communicate that picture of success, throughout the project.</p>



<p>However, according to <a href="https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/195803/employees-really-know-expected.aspx">Gallup</a> only about half of all employees strongly indicate that they know what is expected of them at work.</p>



<p>Wait, hold up. What’s going on here?</p>



<p>We as managers <em>think</em> that expectations are clear – but employees don’t find them clear at all. A gap exists between our own <em>internalization</em> of expectations versus the <em>reality</em> of how well we communicate those expectations. Simply put:&nbsp; We don’t communicate a picture of success clearly, strongly, and often enough.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Specifically, a good pulse-check on how well you’re doing this as leaders is to ask your team members, during each of your one-on-one meetings (<a href="https://canopy.is/m/training_modules/4-how-to-hold-effective-1-1-meetings?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=accountable-wo-micromanaging">which we cover in depth in Canopy</a>), a few of the following questions:</p>



<ul>
<li>Is it clear how we will know if we have been successful?</li>



<li>Is it clear what “great work” looks like?</li>



<li>Is it clear what &#8220;high quality&#8221; looks like?</li>



<li>Is it clear what &#8220;on time&#8221; means?</li>
</ul>



<p>You&#8217;ll notice that all these questions begin with the phrase, &#8220;Is it clear&#8230;&#8221; This underscores how tightly coupled <em>accountability</em> is with <em>clarity</em>. A team doesn’t know what it should be accountable to if those expectations are not made clear. As leaders, it&#8217;s our job to make things clearer than they ever could be.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-do-provide-a-mechanism-to-proactively-communicate-progress-in-an-easeful-automatic-and-asynchronous-way">DO: Provide a mechanism to proactively communicate progress in an easeful, automatic, and asynchronous way.</h3>



<p>If “What’s the status on this?” doesn’t prove to be effective for understanding what <a href="https://canopy.is/blog/2019/04/16/daily-stand-up-meeting-weekly-staff-meeting/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=accountable-wo-micromanaging">progress</a> is being made, what <em>is</em> effective?</p>



<p>The biggest trap you want to avoid is the trap of our team spending more time on summarizing how they&#8217;re progressing rather than on <em>making</em> progress itself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Specifically, you want the way that your team shares progress to be 3 things: &nbsp;</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Easeful</strong>. It should take no more than 5 minutes to write or share the status update.</li>



<li><strong>Automatic</strong>. There should be some kind of regular cadence to the status update, so it feels almost automatic to share each day and/or each week. </li>



<li><strong>Asynchronous</strong>. Give your team the time and space to share an update on their <em>own</em> accord, at the beginning of their own workday, when it makes the most sense to them. <a href="https://canopy.is/blog/2020/03/05/its-time-to-kill-the-daily-stand-up-meeting/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=accountable-wo-micromanaging">Rather than calling a meeting</a> or intruding with DMs at random times of day, an asynchronous schedule with guidelines (e.g., “<em>Please share your status update in Slack every morning</em>”), helps avoid the interruption cycle we discussed earlier that is so disastrous. </li>
</ol>



<p>As a result, here at Canopy, <a href="https://canopy.is/m/tools/heartbeats?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=accountable-wo-micromanaging">we internally use our own Heartbeats</a>. This is an automatic check-in that comes in the form of a daily email and/or <a href="https://canopy.is/m/tools/integrations?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=accountable-wo-micromanaging">Slack message</a> that asks:  &#8220;<em>What did you work on yesterday, and what are you going to work on today?</em>&#8221; This ends up being ensuring the way we&#8217;re communicating status updates is easeful, automatic, and asynchronous</p>



<p>Alternatively, you could ask your team to write a daily Slack or MS Teams message or email update that shares what they worked on yesterday and what they&#8217;re going to work on today and encourage folks to not spend more than a few minutes writing it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whatever you choose, when you ensure that your status update mechanism is easeful, automatic, and asynchronous, sharing progress becomes effective rather than time-consuming.&nbsp;How to hold employees accountable without micromanaging them is rooted in this.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-do-not-increase-pressure-on-deadlines">DO NOT:&nbsp; Increase pressure on deadlines.&nbsp;</h3>



<p>You’re worried. This deadline <em>matters</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can’t shake the feeling of, “Oh my goodness, I <em>really</em> want them to make sure they make this deadline and feel I should say something…”</p>



<p>It’s understandable. As managers, we care about the outcome (which is a wonderfully motivating force!). However, lingering on wanting to exert extra pressure on your team members because &#8220;I <em>really</em> hope they make this deadline&#8221; is sentiment is coming from <em>you</em>, not their work. It involves your <em>own</em> insecurity and anxiety that they might let you down. In fact, it has little to do with the reality of how they&#8217;re doing their work.</p>



<p>When you begin to feel this anxiety and temptation to exert pressure on deadlines, remind yourself:&nbsp; You&#8217;ve done all you can to make the deadlines clear. Further pressure on your team only backfires.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In his seminal work on motivation, Edward Deci found <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Why-We-What-Understanding-Self-Motivation/dp/0140255265/">in his 20 years of research</a> that when pressure was exerted on a person to accomplish a task, performance worsens, quality of outcomes worsens, the person learns less, and the person ends up not enjoying the task as much.</p>



<p>Rather than succumbing to the instinct of &#8220;<em>Oh my goodness, I need to remind my team of this deadline and put on the pressure&#8230;</em>&#8221; keep in mind there&#8217;s something <em>else</em> you can do to ensure that what&#8217;s most important gets done. For when it comes to how to hold employees accountable without micromanaging them, it&#8217;s the following…</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-do-figure-out-what-you-can-take-off-their-plate">DO:&nbsp; Figure out what you can take off their plate.&nbsp;</h3>



<p>If you’re feeling concerned that your team won’t make a deadline, consider taking something <em>off</em> their plate. Everything doesn’t <em>all</em> need to get done now: What is something that isn’t as urgent at the moment? What is something that can wait and reappear later?</p>



<p>Work doesn&#8217;t just &#8220;happen&#8221; – it needs space and time to get done. And it&#8217;s up to you as the leader to create that space and time for your team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a leader, ask yourself: &nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>What can I be taking off their plate so they can meet a deadline and/or achieve what is most important?  </li>



<li>Have I asked “What can I take off your plate?” directly to my direct report, in a one-on-one meeting?</li>



<li>What am I willing to say “no don&#8217;t work on that,” and to say &#8220;yes&#8221; to work on?</li>
</ul>



<p>Space and time are ingredients to high-quality work. Ask yourself these questions as a leader to make sure you’re providing them. This is essential for how to hold employees accountable without micromanaging them.</p>

<p>When things feel tight for our teams, it&#8217;s tempting <a href="https://canopy.is/blog/2019/03/06/dont-solve-problems-if-you-want-to-be-a-great-manager/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=accountable-wo-micromanaging">to do the work for them</a>. You may find this unavoidable, depending on the stage and size of your team, and if upper management and/or the organization has expectations of you as a leader also producing individual contributor work.</p>



<p>However, in many cases, your job as a leader is to <a href="https://canopy.is/blog/2018/03/09/the-most-surprising-principle-of-good-leadership-dont-be-busy/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=accountable-wo-micromanaging"><em>lead</em></a><em>:</em>  To set context and create an environment for your team to be successful – not to do the work itself. </p>



<p>While you might think that jumping in and finishing up someone&#8217;s code is helpful, or taking over a sales call is giving someone a lift in the short run, in the long run, you cultivate a dependency. You send the message to your team: &#8220;<em>Hey, you don&#8217;t have to own this because I&#8217;m overriding your work&#8230;</em>&#8220;</p>



<p>In short, you undercut your team&#8217;s ability to execute and fulfill true responsibility –&nbsp;and you actively stop your team from becoming truly accountable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, how to hold employees accountable without micromanaging them means the following&#8230;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-do-give-guidance-on-what-to-prioritize-first-and-why">DO:&nbsp; Give guidance on what to prioritize first, and why.&nbsp;</h3>



<p>All of the work feels important. However, when you say, &#8220;It&#8217;s all important and we have to get this all done by XX date&#8230;&#8221; you encourage your team not to thoughtfully figure out what is <em>most</em> important, but to haphazardly try to figure everything out at once. Prioritization – knowing what the tackle first and why – leads to strong execution and outcomes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a result, you want to ask yourself as a leader: &nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Am I outlining the <em>accurate</em> level of urgency rather than a perceived level of urgency?</li>



<li>To what degree can I make what is <em>most</em> important clear?</li>
</ul>



<p>Practically speaking, during your weekly or biweekly 1:1 meetings with your team, you can ask the question:  &#8220;Is it clear what your top 3 priorities are?&#8221; to open up the conversation. We do this internally here at <a href="https://canopy.is/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=accountable-wo-micromanaging">Canopy</a>, and find the conversation from that question to be massively useful. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-do-not-making-subtle-conditional-statements-for-what-happens-if-they-make-a-mistake">DO NOT: Making subtle conditional statements for what happens if they make a mistake.</h3>



<p><em>&#8220;We&#8217;re all counting on you for this&#8230;&#8221;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>&#8220;If this doesn&#8217;t work out, this won&#8217;t reflect well on you&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Sound familiar? These statements may all feel true to you – but the real-life reaction and behavior this encourages are not helpful if you&#8217;re trying to create a culture of accountability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>True accountability involves team members stepping up and into their roles and owning responsibility because they want to accomplish something <a href="https://canopy.is/blog/2017/07/25/what-is-company-vision-a-picture-of-a-better-place/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=accountable-wo-micromanaging">bigger</a> – not because they&#8217;re scared that you as the leader will look poorly on them. </p>



<p>Give your team the <em>right</em> reason for why they want to be accountable – rather than one tinged in fear.</p>



<p>This brings us to the last practice of team accountability&#8230;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-do-give-a-reason-for-why-this-matters-and-contributes-to-the-overall-bigger-picture">DO:&nbsp; Give a reason for why this matters and contributes to the overall bigger picture.&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Ultimately, we want our team to be accountable in order to accomplish certain outcomes:&nbsp; We want the world to be better, or an impact to be felt by our clients, the industry, the world. That should be the driving, energetic force if we want accountability to be sustaining and self-generating rather than short-lived or contingent on us making rah-rah speeches as leaders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And so, as leaders, we must ask ourselves:  How are we connecting what needs to get done to the overall bigger picture of what matters? I&#8217;ve written more on how we can do this by <a href="https://canopy.is/blog/2019/07/11/how-to-share-company-vision/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=accountable-wo-micromanaging">co-creating and articulating vision</a> in a team here.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity"/>



<p>From these practices, you’ll notice that creating greater accountability in your team is less about holding your <em>team</em> accountable and more about holding <em>yourself</em> accountable as a leader.</p>



<p>True team accountability is not about checking in on your team more or applying stricter deadlines. True team accountability is about doing everything you can to create the clearest possible picture for what needs to get done and why, and sharing as much context as possible to achieve those expectations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Only then will you create an outcome where the team is taking on greater responsibility, executing their work with fewer mistakes, and even exceeding your expectations what you thought could be possible as great work.</p>



<p>In sum, you can ask yourself these 7 questions to increase accountability without micromanaging your team:</p>



<ul>
<li>Am I making clear how we will know if we&#8217;ve been successful?</li>



<li>Am I giving guidance on what to prioritize first and why?</li>



<li>Am I sharing enough context for my team to navigate uncertainty?</li>



<li>Am I outlining the <em>accurate</em> level of urgency rather than a perceived level of urgency?</li>



<li>How am I helping them see for themselves what progress needs to be made?</li>



<li>What am I taking off my team’s plate so they can appropriately focus on what matters?</li>



<li>How clear is it how their work contributes to the bigger picture?</li>
</ul>



<p>When you keep <em>yourself</em> more accountable as a leader, you keep your team more accountable.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="851" height="368" src="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/motivation-above-and-beyond.png" alt="motivating employees to go above and beyond" class="wp-image-7347"/></figure>



<p>Imagine the best team you&#8217;ve ever been a part of: One where a leader is motivating employees to go above and beyond to achieve a shared purpose. Everyone is contributing their best work and elevates the outcome to be far greater than what was even originally envisioned.</p>



<p>Does it sound like wishful thinking?</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t blame your skepticism.</p>



<p>Trying to figure out how to motivate our team to go above and beyond may feel like a naive quest for an illusionary Holy Grail – especially when maintaining a baseline of motivation can feel like a struggle with our own teams. After all, according to <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/238064/re-engineering-performance-management.aspx">Gallup</a>, only 2 in 10 employees strongly agree that their performance is managed in a way that motivates them to do outstanding work, in the first place.</p>



<p>Motivating employees to go above and beyond must require secret alchemy of high salaries plus unthinkably posh perks plus some trendy goals framework attached to it&#8230; Right?</p>



<p>Wrong. Motivating employees to go above and beyond is not an elusive myth, beholden to only the teams that get lucky or can afford to buy their team&#8217;s motivation.</p>



<p>Rather, motivating a team to go above and beyond requires a rigorous reexamination of what truly motivates a team, and how to connect that motivation to the greater vision of what you&#8217;re pursuing.</p>



<p>Ready to unlearn, and then re-learn? Let&#8217;s jump in&#8230;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-demystifying-employee-motivation">Demystifying employee motivation</h3>



<p>In order to motivate employees to go above and beyond, we must first start with the question: What is motivation, to begin with?</p>



<p>The simplest definition can be reduced to &#8220;motivation is wanting,&#8221; as defined by Roy Baumeister <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11031-015-9521-y">in 2016</a>. The wanting to achieve great work, the wanting to go above and beyond, the wanting to produce a high-quality outcome&#8230; These are &#8220;wantings&#8221; that we aspire our team to intrinsically have. And in the context of the team these wantings – motivation – are immensely powerful.</p>



<p>To increase and direct our team&#8217;s wantings, as leaders, we create and leverage what tools and systems we have: Goals and monetary incentives, most commonly. Perhaps it&#8217;s using the OKRs goals framework, or awarding bonuses when certain milestones are hit, or giving generous healthcare benefits.</p>



<p>While these goals and incentives are helpful, they also overly employ extrinsic motivation. That is, they rely on an external factor to conjure a compelled sense that someone should do something.</p>



<p>Extrinsic motivation can absolutely work for motivating employees to go above and beyond, especially in the short term. However, studies have shown that if you want results to truly be long-lasting, for employees to be motivated to go above and beyond, we must tap into intrinsic motivation.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0734371X11421495">2011 study</a>, in particular, revealed how employees who are intrinsically motivated are three times more engaged than employees who are extrinsically motivated. COVID-19 further exposed this reality for many of us: With the ability for people to work remotely, people&#8217;s desire for roles more aligned with what they personally want for themselves and their lifestyle – intrinsic motivation, in short – has resulted in the &#8220;<a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2021/08/19/how-to-retain-employees/">Great Resignation</a>.&#8221; Extrinsic motivation is not enough.</p>



<p>Intrinsic motivation is what we as leaders are truly looking to tap into if we want our employees to go above and beyond. The kind of motivation that is self-generated, from the employee themselves, around what they want for themselves that contributes to what the team is trying to accomplish.</p>



<p><strong>This requires a reframing of employee motivation for us as leaders, as a whole. </strong>We cannot merely ask: &#8220;How do I motivate my team?&#8221; because doing implies that motivation is a thing we give to our team. But in fact, our team is <em>already</em> motivated intrinsically – they already have beliefs, willingness, ideas, talents, and gifts inside them. Rather, if we want to increase intrinsic motivation in our team, we must ask: <strong>&#8220;How do I create an environment that enables my team to motivate themselves?&#8221;</strong></p>

<p>An <em><a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2017/12/01/the-10-qualities-of-a-true-leader/">environment</a></em> is what we influence as leaders – not people, themselves.</p>



<p>This difference is beyond semantic. When we focus on influencing the environment versus influencing people, we unlock the real secret to enabling motivation: That motivation is not a dial you can crank up nor a series of checkboxes you tick. It is a true commitment to first understanding what motivates your team &#8211; and then connecting what motivates them to what you&#8217;d like the team to accomplish. <strong>Only in this reframing are you able to be motivating employees to go above and beyond.</strong></p>



<p>So, how do we do it? How do we create an environment for our team to tap into their own sense of intrinsic motivation?</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s dive into the 7 practices for motivating employees to go above and beyond&#8230;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="1:-define-the-observable-behavior."># 1: Define the observable behavior.</h4>



<p>What do we want, as leaders? Yes, we want to be motivating our team to go above and beyond&#8230; but above and beyond what? What does &#8220;higher motivation&#8221; exactly mean?</p>



<p>Oftentimes, when we say &#8220;I need to motivate more our team,&#8221; we&#8217;re wildly imprecise in identifying the real output of strong motivation. Does it mean your team is moving faster? Does it mean a higher quality of work? There&#8217;s a large gap between what I call the &#8220;desired descriptor&#8221; and the &#8220;observable behavior.&#8221;</p>



<p>A desired descriptor is a vague generalization. An observable behavior is a specific, tangible action or event that we could point to, so we can anchor future action around it.</p>



<p>For instance, you might say, &#8220;<em>I want more engagement</em>,&#8221; but what you really mean is, &#8220;<em>I want more participation in the learning opportunities we give our staff.</em>&#8221; The former is the desired descriptor – a fuzzy notion of an idea. The latter is an observable behavior – a firm, noticeable event we&#8217;d like to see happen.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s another example: You might say, &#8220;<em>I want better performance</em>,&#8221; but what you really mean is &#8220;<em>I want our team to have a higher bar for the quality of work</em>.&#8221; The former, as a desired descriptor, doesn&#8217;t give you much basis for action. The latter precisely identifies an observable behavior you&#8217;d like to pursue.</p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow">
<div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-3 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex">

</div>



<p></p>
</div></div>



<p>See the difference?</p>



<p>This distinction between the desired descriptor and observable behavior is critical because if we&#8217;re unable to zero in on exactly what we want to change, then we have no hope of changing it.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="2:-play-detective.">#2: Play detective.</h4>



<p>You know what you want&#8230; But what does your <em>team</em> want?</p>



<p>Yes, you&#8217;ve identified the observable behavior you&#8217;d like to see being exhibited by your team. But how does your <em>team</em> feel about it? What is your <em>team</em> motivated by?</p>



<p>To uncover what your <em>team</em> exactly wants, here are some questions you can ask your team members during a <a href="http://knowyourteam.com/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=inline_link">1:1 meeting</a> around motivation:</p>



<ul id="draft_check_box_list_0"><li>What project or part of your job do you feel most energized or excited about working on? Why?</li><li>What project or part of your job do you feel most in your &#8220;flow state&#8221;? Why?</li><li>Which project do you most look forward to working on? Why?</li><li>When have felt most proud to have been a part of the organization? Why?</li><li>In your work life, what would you feel most deeply motivates you or feels most rewarding?</li></ul>



<p>These questions can give you a sense of what your team wants – and so you can better align that wanting with the observable behavior you&#8217;d like to see different.</p>



<p>Eager for more of these questions around motivation? Be sure to check out our <a href="http://knowyourteam.com/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=inline_link">training program</a>, which includes an entire module on how to run effective 1:1 meetings and gives you templates and questions to choose from.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="3:-individualize-everything.">#3: Individualize everything.</h4>



<p>Motivation is personal. What motivates your newest hire might not be what motivates someone who&#8217;s been on your team for a long time. Everyone&#8217;s source of motivation is different.</p>



<p>While this truth feels obvious, we often unintentionally as leaders project our own preferences, ideas, and sources of motivation onto others. Recently, I was speaking with a leader who was confused about why a team member was struggling. &#8220;<em>I love projects like this</em>,&#8221; this leader told me. It wasn&#8217;t until after we examined the scenario together did this executive realize this team member was struggling with work because <em>the team member disliked ambiguity</em> – and she as a leader loved ambiguity.</p>



<p>Feel familiar? No worries, it happens to the best of us. As a result, we must align projects, goals, communication, and incentives with what the other person is motivated by, if motivating employees to go above and beyond is our intention.</p>



<p>Here are some examples of how you can do this&#8230;</p>



<ul><li>If a direct report is motivated by public recognition, give public recognition to a direct report when a project is complete.</li><li>If a direct report is motivated by detailed work, switch your direct report to be focused on more detail-oriented initiatives, instead of creative projects.</li><li>If a direct report is motivated by having deep thinking time, move or cancel a video chat meeting so a direct report has more uninterrupted time to work.</li></ul>



<p>Whew. If this sounds like a lot of work&#8230;it&#8217;s because it is <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Individualization requires effort and time to do, especially the more direct reports you have.</p>



<p>However, individualization is a core tenet of practicing great leadership. <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2020/04/16/how-to-best-support-remote-employees/">Creating the best environment for our team</a> relies on our ability to create the best environment for each specific person. There are no shortcuts.</p>

<p>Admittedly, you may not be able to individualize all the time. Sometimes there are projects that have to get done – and you can&#8217;t customize or individualize them. What do you do in those situations? Read on.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="4:-stop-surveillance.-give-choice.">#4: Stop surveillance. Give choice.</h4>



<p>While you can’t always perfectly individualize and align someone’s project and goals with what they are most motivated by, you can create positive conditions for motivation by giving <em>choice</em> in what people can do. In Edward Deci’s formative book on human motivation theory, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Why-We-What-Understanding-Self-Motivation/dp/0140255265">Why We Do What We Do</a>, he describes how “meaningful choice engenders willingness” and results in a higher quality of decisions, and greater motivation and commitment to the task, shown from research he’s done over 20 years. </p>



<p>Here are some scenarios for how you can give choice in situations even when it feels like there might not be much choice, to begin with&#8230;</p>



<ul id="draft_check_box_list_1"><li>Instead of dictating the approach to a project, give options to an employee for how they&#8217;d like to approach the project and which tools they&#8217;d like to use.</li><li>Instead of imposing when the exact deadline should be for a project, give choice by asking, &#8220;What deadline do you think makes the most sense, given the context of this project?&#8221;</li><li>Instead of assigning a direct report a set of goals, invite them to participate in the formation of those goals so they have a choice in goals set.</li></ul>



<p>Even further, as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Why-We-What-Understanding-Self-Motivation/dp/0140255265">described</a> by Deci, studies have revealed that when people can actively choose their own goals, they’re more likely to follow through on them. And so, choice is critical in creating an environment for motivating employees to go above and beyond.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="5:-highlight-progress.">#5: Highlight progress – efficiently and meaningfully.</h4>



<p>What makes for a &#8220;great day at work&#8221;?</p>



<p>A landmark study <a href="https://hbr.org/2010/01/the-hbr-list-breakthrough-ideas-for-2010">shared</a> by Harvard Business Review in 2010 sought to answer this question, in which they examined the diary entries of nearly 12,000 workers. From this, they found that making progress in one&#8217;s work (even incremental!) is more frequently associated with positive emotions and high motivation more than any other workday event. </p>



<p>Not getting a raise. Not getting a compliment from their boss. Making progress is what made for &#8220;a great day at work.&#8221;</p>



<p>Consider for yourself the same question: What makes for a &#8220;great day at work&#8221; for you? When you talk to your partner or a friend at the end of the workday and they ask you &#8220;How was work today?&#8221; what influences your response to them the most?</p>



<p>Like the 12,000 workers studied, you might find a similar sense of &#8220;a great day&#8221; equating to making progress at work. The days we get stuck, where had meetings all day and got nothing done, or aren&#8217;t sure why or how our work is helping us move forward, is massively demotivating. And the days where we make progress feel exemplary.</p>



<p>As a result, as leaders, we must be vigilant about proactively sharing progress as much as possible for motivating employees to go above and beyond. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" width="600" height="338" src="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/8.jpg" alt="To increase motivation, ask yourself:
 What's the mechanism that proactive consistently shares progress?" class="wp-image-7344"/></figure>



<p>Here are two high-leverage ways to do this:</p>



<p><strong>Automatic status updates</strong>: Rather than asking your team to write up a lengthy progress report every week or attend lengthy <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2020/03/05/its-time-to-kill-the-daily-stand-up-meeting/">status update meetings</a>, keep your day-to-day status updates efficient and consistent. Specifically, consider automating your progress updates as much as possible. Here at <a href="http://knowyourteam.com/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=inline_link">Know Your Team</a>, we use our own <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/heartbeats/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">Heartbeat Check-in</a> every single day as a way to proactively share progress. Every day, each person shares what they worked on yesterday and what they&#8217;re going to work on today – and it gives an easy way for everyone to have a high-level view of what progress we&#8217;re making as a team, while saving us time and effort in the process.</p>



<p><strong>Meaningful &#8220;big picture&#8221; write-up of progress:</strong> To help your team understand how their day-to-day progress fits into the greater progress of the team, you&#8217;ll want to spend some time each week or each month (or both) writing up how the team as a whole is making progress. Here at <a href="http://knowyourteam.com/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=inline_link">Know Your Team</a>, I do this by writing a brief update to the team every Monday that answers: &#8220;<em>How are we tracking toward our big picture goals and priorities this month?</em>&#8221; And every month, I write up an in-depth summary of &#8220;<em>How did we do last month, and what are we looking toward for next month?</em>&#8221; Both big picture write-ups highlight progress on a more macro level and give greater coherence to the work each of us is doing on a day-to-day basis.</p>



<p>Progress is an engine for motivation. But it begs the question: What is your team making progress <em>towards</em>? Keep reading for the answer&#8230;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="6:-illustrate-a-picture-of-a-better-place.">#6: Go big on a &#8220;picture of a better place.&#8221;</h4>



<p>We&#8217;ve discussed how to create conditions for your team to feel motivated&#8230; But what is it that we want our team to feel motivated <em>about</em>? There must be some ultimate outcome, some culminating end state that is compelling and animating your team to feel excited in the first place, and motivating employees to go above and beyond.</p>



<p>That would be <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2017/07/25/what-is-company-vision-a-picture-of-a-better-place/">vision</a>: A picture of a better place. A picture of what the future world looks like because of the work you do. The clearer the vision is, the clearer that your team understands what their work adds up to and what they&#8217;re building towards.</p>



<p>The question is: How clear have you been <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2019/07/11/how-to-share-company-vision/">illustrating this vision</a>? I recently spoke with a CEO who admitted that though their mission and values were very clear, their vision was blurry. &#8220;<em>I&#8217;ve been talking a lot about the work we do</em>,&#8221; shared this CEO, &#8220;<em>but not illustrating the end state, the better world we create, because of it</em>.&#8221;</p>



<p>For instance, here are <a href="http://knowyourteam.com/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=inline_link">Know Your Team</a>, our mission is to help leaders become better. But that&#8217;s not our vision – because &#8220;<em>helping leaders become better</em>&#8221; doesn&#8217;t describe a future world or end outcome. Rather, our <em>vision</em> is &#8220;<em>a world where bad bosses are the exception and not the norm</em>.&#8221;</p>



<p>Our mission describes what we <em>do</em> today. Our vision describes what we&#8217;d like the world to look like <em>because</em> of what we do, in the future.</p>



<p>Consider the company <a href="http://apple.com">Apple</a> as another example. Their mission, one might say, is &#8220;<em>to create products that make people&#8217;s lives easier and more enjoyable</em>.&#8221; But their vision – the picture of a better place –&nbsp;is &#8220;<em>a world where more meaningful connection and work happens, delightfully, and simply</em>.&#8221;</p>



<p>Notice the difference? The more we as leaders can illustrate vision, rather than just mission, the more that we can create an environment that motivates employees to go above and beyond.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="7:-clarify-expectations.-(it's-never-too-clear.)">#7: Clarify expectations. (It&#8217;s never too clear.)</h4>



<p>We all recognize the importance of setting clear expectations as leaders. And yet, according to a <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/238064/re-engineering-performance-management.aspx">2017 survey by Gallup</a>, only 50% of employees clearly know what is expected of them at work. Furthermore, only 26% of employees strongly agree that their manager continually helps them clarify priorities.</p>



<p>A gap exists. As leaders, we have strong expectations for what the work should look like – but we don&#8217;t always communicate that up front. We must bridge this gap, as an employee can&#8217;t tap into their own sense of motivation if they don&#8217;t know what they should be doing in the first place.</p>



<p>Ask yourself: How can you make expectations for great work even clearer?</p>



<p>Specifically, you can ask your team members directly in one-on-one meetings:</p>



<ul id="draft_check_box_list_2"><li>Is it clear what projects are most important?</li><li>Is it clear why the project matters?</li><li>Is it clear why the level of urgency around the project exists?</li><li>Is it clear what &#8220;success&#8221; for this project looks like?</li><li>Is it clear what external factors the team should consider in order to successfully execute this project?</li></ul>

<p>I hope these 7 practices provide a useful starting point, as you consider motivating employees to go above and beyond. Keep in mind: These are <em>practices</em>. They require <em>repeated</em> implementation and enacting to get us closer to where we want to be. Motivation won&#8217;t just &#8220;appear&#8221; overnight. Rather, it&#8217;s the outcomes of these repeated actions that focus on creating the right environment, rather than trying to manipulate people.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-focus-on-these-3-areas-for-how-to-coach-an-employee-who-is-performing-well">Focus on these 3 areas for how to coach an employee who is performing well.</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="555" src="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/coaching-top-performer-3.jpg" alt="how to coach an employee who is performing well" class="wp-image-7298"/></figure>



<p>When we think about <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2021/08/19/the-3-stay-conversations-to-improve-employee-retention/">coaching</a> employees, we often focus on how to coach an <em>underperforming</em> employee –&nbsp;not how to coach an employee who is <em>performing well</em>.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s natural. The employee whose negative attitude needs addressing or the employee who habitually makes mistakes is the one who attracts our attention. We channel our coaching toward team members who seem to be <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2018/10/22/14-questions-to-ask-an-underperforming-employee-during-a-one-on-one-meeting/">struggling</a> because it feels urgent to address and solve&#8230; But often we forget how to coach an employee who is performing well, in the process.</p>



<p>This is an enormous oversight. Our team&#8217;s best work, after all, is often overly reliant on team members who are exceedingly excellent: The team member who silently takes on more work. The team member who proactively finds solutions to challenges you didn&#8217;t anticipate.</p>



<p>Without our best-performing employees, what are we as leaders left with?</p>



<p>Consider this: If a team member gave you their two weeks&#8217; notice tomorrow, how much money of your own salary would be willing to give up to encourage them to stay?</p>



<p>Reflect on what your internal reaction is. If without hesitation, you were willing to put <em>any</em> amount of money down of your own salary to keep this person, that&#8217;s a clear indication that this employee is a high performer, and someone you want to make an active effort to keep.</p>



<p>Given this, how much coaching do you dedicate toward your high-performing employees <em>right now</em>?</p>



<p>If your answer is &#8220;not enough coaching,&#8221; read on for my recommendations for how to coach an employee who is performing well.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-areas-to-focus-on-for-how-to-coach-an-employee-who-is-performing-well">3 areas to focus on for how to coach an employee who is performing well</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1:-understand-their-core-motivation.">#1:  Understand their core motivation.</h3>



<p>Coaching a high-performing employee well begins with understanding what this person is motivated by. Someone who is performing well is already typically highly motivated. </p>



<p>But do we know <em>exactly</em> what a top-performing employee&#8217;s source of motivation is?</p>



<p>Take a quick minute to reflect on this question:</p>



<p>If you had to guess, what would you say your top-performers are most motivated by?</p>



<ul id="draft_check_box_list_0"><li>Autonomy and control in work</li><li>Benefits and perks</li><li>Career progression opportunities</li><li>Challenging projects</li><li>Meaningful problem</li><li>Public recognition</li><li>Salary increases</li><li>Work-life balance</li><li>All of the above</li><li>Other</li></ul>



<p>Now let&#8217;s reflect on this second question:</p>



<p>For your top-performers, how <em>certain</em> do you feel you know what they are motivated by?</p>



<ul id="draft_check_box_list_1"><li>Very certain</li><li>Somewhat certain</li><li>Not certain at all</li></ul>



<p>If you&#8217;re like most leaders (myself included!), you likely answered, &#8220;Somewhat certain&#8221; or &#8220;Not certain at all.&#8221; That&#8217;s because most of us as leaders have <em>general</em> ideas for what might motivate our top-performers –&nbsp;but haven&#8217;t truly asked them directly. </p>



<p>As a result, you&#8217;ll want to actively ask questions in your one-on-one meetings around their core motivations. <strong>Specifically, try asking these questions in your next one-on-one meeting for how to coach an employee who is performing well:</strong></p>



<ul id="draft_check_box_list_2"><li>When has it been a time when you’ve felt most motivated in the work that you were doing? </li><li>What three events in your life would you say have had the biggest impact on you and why?</li><li>Who do you admire most in your life, and why?</li><li>What do you value more than anything else?</li><li>What would you say most deeply motivates you?</li></ul>



<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />  <em>These one-on-one questions around motivation (and 100+ more coaching questions) can be found in our <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/training/organizations?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=inline_link">One-on-Ones module in Know Your Team</a>. </em></p>



<p>You might find that these precise questions may not feel entirely comfortable for you to ask. Perhaps they seem a bit  &#8220;fluffy&#8221; or &#8220;vague&#8221;&#8230;.which is absolutely fine! You don&#8217;t have to ask these questions directly, but rather, you can focus on observing how your top-performer behaves:  What are they most excited to talk about in their work?  When have you seen them truly thrive and seem energized in the work they&#8217;re doing? What actions might you be able to detect that reveal what they are most motivated by?</p>



<p>The main takeaway, regardless of what you ask or what you observe, is to challenge yourself as a leader to better understand your high performer&#8217;s core motivations if you want to coach them well.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2:-give-choice-that-aligns-with-their-core-motivation.">#2:  Give <em>choice</em> that aligns with their core motivation.</h3>



<p>After you&#8217;ve had a one-on-one meeting to better understand their core motivation, you&#8217;ll want to focus your coaching on providing choice to your high-performing employee that aligns with their core motivation.</p>



<p>Choice is what enables a person&#8217;s <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2019/09/06/how-to-motivate-employees-dont-do-this-instead/">intrinsic motivation</a> to thrive, as found in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Why-We-What-Understanding-Self-Motivation/dp/0140255265">research</a> by Edward Deci. When you give someone optionality for how to do their work or approach their work, their desire to invest more in it and feel excited about that work increases. This is critical for how to coach an employee who is performing well.</p>



<p><strong>Here are a few examples of how you can do this:</strong></p>



<p>If your top-performing employee is most motivated by challenging projects, give choice around what projects they can work on. For instance, try asking in your coaching conversation: &#8220;Which aspect of the last project did you enjoy most, so I can consider that for future projects we work on?&#8221;</p>



<p>If your top-performing employee is most motivated by public recognition, give choice around how they might want to be recognized. For instance, try asking in your coaching conversation: &#8220;How do you prefer to be recognized for a job well done?&#8221;</p>



<p>If your top-performing employee is most motivated by work-life balance, give choice around their workday schedule. For instance, try asking in your coaching conversation: &#8220;What meeting can we move around to better accommodate your schedule?&#8221;</p>

<p>Whichever questions you try during your one-on-one meetings, consider how you might increase the amount of choice you give your top performers.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3:-connect-their-work-to-progress-toward-their-core-motivation.">#3:  Connect their work toward <em>progress</em> toward their core motivation.</h3>



<p>Progress is a motivational multiplier. In research reported in Harvard Business Review, making progress on work every day was revealed as the #1 source of motivation for employees. As a result, the more you can connect how your top performer is making progress in line with their core motivation, the better.</p>



<p><strong>Specifically, here are some examples of how to coach an employee who is performing well, in this way:</strong></p>



<p>If your top-performing employee is most motivated by career progression opportunities, emphasize how their work today will generate momentum toward career progression opportunities. For example, you can say, &#8220;Here&#8217;s how the work you&#8217;re doing today will get you to that next level&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>If your top-performing employee is most motivated by meaningful problems, underline the meaningful problem you&#8217;re working toward. For example, you can say, &#8220;Here&#8217;s how the work you&#8217;re doing today directly impacts this problem we&#8217;re trying to solve&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>If your top-performing employee is most motivated by a salary increase, explain the connection between how progress will correspond to a potential salary increase. For example, you can say, &#8220;Here&#8217;s how the work you&#8217;re doing will get you to the next level, salary-wise&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>As a whole, take a moment to ask yourself as a leader: How can I strengthen the connection between a top performer&#8217;s work progress and their core motivation?</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity"/>



<p>These three steps – understanding motivation, giving choice around that motivation, and connecting it to progress – are the foundations of how to coach an employee who is performing well. Too long have we gone without dedicating enough time and rigor toward coaching our top-performing employees. If we do want our best employees to stay, it starts with this coaching.</p>

<p>We all want to improve <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2021/08/19/how-to-retain-employees/">employee retention</a>. The question is how?</p>



<p>Our knee-jerk answers to this question can feel opaque. Pay, perks, and promotion opportunities could matter… but to what degree? Employee recognition programs or more social activities could be helpful aspects… or will those efforts feel superficial? <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/training/organizations?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=inline_link">Training for new managers</a> could also be beneficial… but who needs to be trained, and on what skillset areas?</p>



<p>The fog begins to lift when we have a conversation with our team members <em>themselves</em>. We must talk one-on-one with our team members to best understand what their current experience of work is like, and how it can be better. </p>



<p>Sure, a survey or two can be helpful for giving data points of general sentiments – but when we sit down in-person or in front of a video call, face-to-face with our team members, we capture the nuance for <em>what is encouraging that specific person </em>to stay. Rather than broad generalizations of our own projected assumptions, a conversation shines a light on what we can do for each particular person we want to stay. Only then can we understand exactly what steps to take.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What conversations should you be having to improve employee retention?</p>



<p>I’ve identified 3 conversations in particular that you as a leader can be having with your direct reports to improve the likelihood of employee retention.&nbsp; I call them “The Three Stay Conversations”&nbsp; as they focus on identifying the aspects of the work itself that encourage someone to <a href="https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/employee-relations/pages/how-to-use-stay-conversations-to-keep-employees-engaged.aspx">stay</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-stay-conversation-1-work-clarifying-questions"><strong>Stay Conversation #1:&nbsp; Work Clarifying Questions</strong></h3>



<p>Ask these 3 questions around work <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2019/09/06/how-to-motivate-employees-dont-do-this-instead/">motivation</a> to understand what might encourage your employee to stay:</p>



<ul><li>In the past few months, when have you felt most motivated or energized in your work (if at all)?</li><li>Is it clear why the work you do matters to the organization?</li><li>Which of your skills do you feel is not being used in your current role?&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>From the answers of these questions, you’ll learn how to better adjust projects and areas that an employee is working on, along with what the employee’s role is, so their work is aligned with what your employee might be most motivated by.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-stay-conversation-2-dynamics-questions"><strong>Stay Conversation #2:&nbsp; Dynamics Questions</strong></h3>



<p>Ask these 3 questions around team <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2021/06/24/how-to-manage-former-peers-as-a-new-manager/">dynamics</a> to understand what might encourage your employee to stay:</p>



<ul><li>Is there any part of the team you wish you got to interact with more?</li><li>How do you feel about the current level of social interaction across the team?</li><li>How do you prefer to be recognized for work well done?</li></ul>



<p>These questions help reveal the degree of social interaction, team closeness, and positive recognition that an employee desires. From this, you can then consider how to craft opportunities for rapport and connection to be fostered throughout the organization.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-stay-conversation-3-context-questions"><strong>Stay Conversation #3:  Context Questions</strong></h3>



<p>Ask these 3 questions around organizational <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2019/07/11/how-to-share-company-vision/">context</a> to understand what might encourage your employee to stay:</p>



<ul><li>Is there any aspect of the organization that you wish you knew more about?</li><li>What’s felt confusing or frustrating for you lately?</li><li>To what degree would you say the vision of the organization is clear?</li></ul>



<p>The answers to these questions can give you an accurate picture of how informed an employee feels in their current work environment, and how that might be affecting their experience of work. From this, you can then change how and what context you’re sharing (or not sharing) in the workplace.</p>



<p><em><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4a1.png" alt="💡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> All three of these stay conversations can be found in our <a href="http://knowyourteam.com/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=inline_link">one-on-one templates in our One-on-Ones guide in Know Your Team</a>. </em></p>



<p>Try holding these Three Stay Conversations in your one-on-one meetings once a month, or at the very least, once a quarter. Alternatively, you can try interweaving these questions into your weekly <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2020/05/14/the-best-way-to-hold-a-remote-one-on-one-meeting/">one-on-one meetings</a>, in whatever order feels right to you. </p>



<p>However you might look to implement the Three Stay Conversations, know that it’s the quality of these conversations that will help you improve employee retention in a meaningful way.</p>

<p>Everyone is quitting. Or at least, that&#8217;s what the headlines are announcing, clamoring for how to retain employees during this &#8220;<a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/24/1007914455/as-the-pandemic-recedes-millions-of-workers-are-saying-i-quit">Great Resignation</a>.&#8221;</p>



<p>According to a recent survey <a href="https://www.axios.com/post-pandemic-job-turnover-04cdedcb-ddd6-4b20-b936-70b1cc2595aa.html">published</a> by Prudential, 1 in 4 workers plans to look for a different job once the pandemic has subsided. The Bureau of Labor Statistics <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/jolts.nr0.htm">reported</a> that 5 million more people left their jobs this time of year than they did last year. Prudential’s Vice Chair  <a href="https://www.axios.com/post-pandemic-job-turnover-04cdedcb-ddd6-4b20-b936-70b1cc2595aa.html">said</a> himself that &#8220;flight risk was the number one concern&#8221; keeping him up at night. And, amongst our own leaders who we work with during our <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/workshops/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">Workshop Live!</a> in June 2021, 30% of people out of 223 attendees said that keeping their best employees was their #1 concern.</p>



<p>Given this, perhaps it&#8217;s a concern for you too:&nbsp; How to retain employees, and encourage your best employees to stay?</p>



<p>Your immediate answers, as a leader, might be to focus on the following: (1) Salary (2) Growth opportunities and promotions (3) Recognition. You might feel your organization likely isn’t paying someone enough, giving enough room for this person to be promoted, and/or not publicly recognizing them.</p>



<p>That might be true. But while these factors are valuable and likely <em>contributors</em> to why someone stays, these areas overlook a primary factor in employee retention:&nbsp; The work itself.</p>



<p><strong>The work itself, after all, is the core of <em>what someone spends their time doing </em>if they decide to stay.</strong> The work itself is what a person interacts with, ruminates on, and is immersed in, day in day out. The quality of the <em>experience</em> of work –&nbsp; what a person is being asked to think about and act on – drives their decision to stay or not and how to retain employees more than we realize. </p>



<p>Yes, we can raise their pay. Yes, we can give them a promotion. Yes, we can publicly recognize them more. But if the experience of the work itself isn’t interesting, challenging, invigorating, or purposeful – your employee will feel they’ve reached a dead end.</p>



<p>This presents a dubious challenge:  You need to make the work interesting and meaningful if you want to retain your best employees. How?</p>



<p>You may be thinking to yourself:&nbsp; &#8220;Oh Claire, but the work at my organization is <em>NOT</em> that interesting, and I don&#8217;t know how I can make it more interesting&#8230;&#8221; You may feel that the field domain is not compelling or exciting, or that you’re asking your team to perform repetitive rote tasks that you can’t “dress up.”</p>



<p>Despite this, you can <em>still</em> focus on the work itself in three aspects:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-progress"><strong>(1) Progress. </strong></h3>



<p>Illustrate forward momentum. Make exceedingly clear how the work your team did yesterday is helping them make a difference in where they are at tomorrow. Then, make that path to progress easier as a leader. Specifically:</p>



<ul><li>Carve out at least 10 minutes during your weekly or monthly <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2019/06/27/what-to-put-on-your-team-meeting-agenda/">all-team meetings</a> to share your team&#8217;s <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2017/07/25/what-is-company-vision-a-picture-of-a-better-place/">vision</a>. How is the work you&#8217;re doing today contributing to the bigger picture of where you&#8217;re headed? Why does the work the team is doing matter? What impact is it having on customers and/or internally in the organization?</li><li>Find a way to automate your <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2020/03/05/its-time-to-kill-the-daily-stand-up-meeting/">status update meetings</a>, so regular progress can be consistently shared.</li><li>Ask in your next one-on-one meeting:  &#8220;Where do you feel stalled on progress? What can we brainstorm together so that path of progress is clearer?&#8221;</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-meaning"><strong>(2) Meaning. </strong></h3>



<p>Work only has meaning when it&#8217;s within the context of what the individual finds meaningful. As a result, you&#8217;ll need to ask your team members, &#8220;What do you care about most?&#8221; in order to then connect the work they&#8217;re doing to what they believe matters.  Specifically:</p>



<ul><li>Share a direct client testimonial or specific story for how the work they did made a significant impact in an area they care about during an all-team meeting.</li><li>Give a genuine shout-out to a team member on how something specific they did contributed to a larger positive outcome and/or elevated a team&#8217;s value. </li><li>Ask in your next one-on-one meeting: &#8220;What aspect of your job do you find most motivating?&#8221;</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-choice"><strong>(3) Choice. </strong></h3>



<p>You may not be able to give choice around what project to work on, but you CAN give team members choice in other areas. Big or small, choice matters. Specifically:</p>



<ul><li>Give several options around <em>how</em> to approach a project.</li><li>Suggest folks outside the immediate team for <em>who</em> to work with. </li><li>Provide options on the timing of meetings (once a week or biweekly, mornings or afternoons).</li><li>Ask in your next one-on-one meeting:  &#8220;What&#8217;s an area of work that you feel you&#8217;d appreciate greater flexibility and autonomy in?&#8221;</li></ul>



<p>Looking to pile on money, a promotion, or praise for how to retain employees – while all helpful – doesn&#8217;t get to the core of what an employee would <em>do</em> if they were to stay. </p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="400" src="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/slowing-down-1024x400.jpg" alt="most important leadership principle" class="wp-image-7030"/></figure>



<p>The most important leadership principle I wish I&#8217;d known earlier is this: Slow down.</p>



<p>To give myself permission to pause and see things from a different point of view. To question my own initial reaction. To create space to dig deeper to solve an underlying root cause instead of projecting what I think other leaders would do in a certain situation.</p>



<p>When you don&#8217;t take time to slow down as a leader, you start to cram, you start to rush – and you start to believe a narrative that you <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2017/08/16/dont-empower-anybody-the-biggest-leadership-mistake/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">control</a> everything as the leader. That you are at the center of it all, and it will absolutely all work if you only push harder.</p>



<p>This couldn&#8217;t be further from reality. When you are the leader, yes, you have a title and responsibilities – but the only thing you truly control are the inputs that shape an <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2017/12/01/the-10-qualities-of-a-true-leader/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">environment</a>. You are a creator of context for your team: A steward of the team&#8217;s vision, an arbiter of &#8220;good enough&#8221; and &#8220;what&#8217;s right&#8221; in the organization, a vessel for communication, and a catalyzer for aligned action. But you are not the puppet master. You do not control your team.</p>



<p>When we forget to slow down, as the most important leadership principle, we forget this. With that forgetfulness, we, as leaders, insulate ourselves from opposing views and admonish feedback. We overstep, immerse ourselves too in-the-weeds, and change direction without bothering to explain the why. We become preoccupied with how things &#8220;appear&#8221; to our team, instead of asking how a change could in fact be of real service to the team. We cancel meaningful opportunities to connect with the team because we &#8220;just don&#8217;t have the time.&#8221;</p>



<p>I&#8217;m reminded of the beautiful quote by <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/man-s-search-for-meaning-9780807014271/9780807014271">Victor Frankl</a>, who wrote: “Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.”</p>



<p>When you slow down, you create that space. Space for a thoughtful response. Space to ask the imminent question all leaders must ask: &#8220;How am I creating an environment for my team do to their best work?&#8221;</p>



<p>Are you slowing down enough to ask yourself this question, regularly? Are you slowing down enough to remember this most important leadership principle regularly?</p>



<p>As your day winds down, I urge you to reflect on this. To consider if you can slow down enough, even for a minute, to reflect on if you&#8217;ve been upholding your highest use as a leader – and in what ways.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="429" src="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Anxiety-1024x429.png" alt="leadership anxiety" class="wp-image-7005"/></figure>



<p>A wave of leadership anxiety hit me last week. My unending to-do list, the pressure of not wanting to let my team down, and my own voice of &#8220;You need to be doing more&#8221; and &#8220;You&#8217;re not doing enough&#8221; rung in my ears and tossed me around as mercilessly as the ocean might.</p>



<p>Famed leadership coach <a href="https://twitter.com/jerrycolonna">Jerry Colonna</a> <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/podcast/episode-51-interview-with-jerry-colonna-coach-and-ceo-at-reboothq/">calls</a> this manifestation of leadership anxiety &#8220;the Crow&#8221;, the negative inner critic who is squawking in your ear. But last week, the Crow seemed to have installed a megaphone inside my brain, and so its distant caw became a boom of lightning and thunder.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-do-you-know-the-feeling">Do you know the feeling?</h2>



<p>Anxiety might be the most universal felt experience of leadership. Some may call it &#8220;impostor syndrome&#8221; or &#8220;negative self-talk.&#8221; It manifests for each of us in slightly different ways: Paralyzing fear of doing the wrong thing, overcompensating with hours and force, frequent direction changes that give our team whiplash.</p>



<p>But the most frequent side effect of leadership anxiety is one I noticed last week&#8230;</p>



<p>While I was in my tumultuous moment of leadership anxiety, I happened to read a note from one of my colleagues at <a href="http://knowyourteam.com/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=inline_link">Know Your Team</a>. He had an idea about something new we should consider at a company. After reading his note, my instinctive reaction to his idea in my head was, &#8220;That&#8217;s a terrible idea&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Thank goodness I didn&#8217;t say or write that because when I woke up the next morning, rested and clear-eyed, I re-read my colleague&#8217;s message again: It was fine. In fact, it was a great idea&nbsp;– an idea that I almost dismissed because I&#8217;d been too lost in my own interior fog. I hadn&#8217;t seen the truth of the situation for what it was, because I was so caught up in my own leadership anxiety.</p>



<p>It made me think: How many other ideas had I unknowingly discarded or held in contempt, simply because the anxiety and judgment I held for myself was so high that I projected it outward to everything and everyone around me?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-unknowing-consequence">The unknowing consequence</h2>



<p>I realized that <strong>the most common unwanted consequence of leadership anxiety is that we unknowingly transfer that anxiety onto our <em>team.</em></strong></p>



<p>When we feel we&#8217;re not working hard enough, we tell our team they need to work harder. When we feel the pressure of a deadline, we move everyone&#8217;s deadlines up. When we feel our own ideas are terrible, we tell our team &#8220;your ideas need to be better.&#8221;</p>



<p>When we spiral into leadership anxiety, we react to our own inner drama, rather than the reality of the world. It&#8217;s not that our team isn&#8217;t working hard enough&#8230; We&#8217;re self-conscious of our worth ethic. It&#8217;s not that team&#8217;s ideas aren&#8217;t good&#8230; We don&#8217;t like our <em>own</em> ideas.</p>



<p>The same anxiety that stifles us stifles our team.</p>



<p>While you <em>feel</em> like you can bear the weight of the world and that being the most self-critical person in your organization is &#8220;your job&#8221; as a leader – remember all the ways, big and small, you transfer those anxieties to your team.</p>



<p>I had to remember this for myself last week.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-so-what-do-we-do-when-we-feel-this-leadership-anxiety">So, what do we do when we feel this leadership anxiety?</h2>



<p>Even though we may know this reality, remembering it often does not help us <em>in the moment</em> to change our reality.</p>



<p>Leadership anxiety can be all-consuming: How can we possibly shed ourselves of this anxiety when we feel it, so it doesn&#8217;t cripple ourselves or our team?</p>



<p>Here three techniques that I personally use that perhaps you might find helpful. I call them, The Check-in, The Quack, and The Walk:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-the-check-in">(1) The Check-in </h3>



<p><strong>Name the emotion to create space &#8211; and a path forward.  </strong>In order to address our leadership anxiety, we must first check in with ourselves, and ask: &#8220;What am I feeling? What would I call this?&#8221; For myself, last week, I realized I was feeling &#8220;Fear.&#8221; Recognizing this clarified my perspective almost immediately: I realized what I was reacting to. When we name how we&#8217;re feeling, it gives us space to see the emotion more objectively, more clearly, and so we can begin a better process of relating to it. Otherwise, the negative emotions of leadership anxiety gain power over us when we fail to see them for what they are.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-the-quack">(2) The Quack</h3>



<p><strong>Use a “cue word” to thought-stop and be diverted from a course of thinking.</strong> Dr. Brian R. Little describes in his seminal <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Me-Myself-Us-Personality-Well-Being/dp/1610396383">research</a> how important it is to interrupt a negative thought pattern for oneself to stop perpetuating it. In his delightful and incisive book, he describes how for himself, when he&#8217;d notice a negative or circular thought pattern for himself, he would literally say the word, &#8220;QUACK&#8221; out loud to himself. This is an amusing example, but the core tenant is salient: We can use a &#8220;cue word&#8221; to shift our attention and create room for ourselves to see the negative thought pattern of leadership anxiety, rather than succumb to it.</p>



<p>(If at all helpful, my &#8220;Quack&#8221; work is &#8220;Jumping Jacks!&#8221; because the image of someone or myself all of sudden doing jumping jacks makes me smile. This word can truly be anything that best suits you.)</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-the-walk">(3) The Walk</h3>



<p><strong>Move to a different physical location to shake up your perspective.</strong> We all have an activity or two that helps us clear our heads. Perhaps it&#8217;s a walk around your neighborhood. Or perhaps it&#8217;s making a cup of coffee for yourself. Whatever your go-to activity might be, this physical movement and change in physical perspective can be massively helpful in breaking us out of a spiral of leadership anxiety we might feel. Much research has already <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/well/mind/exercise-may-help-to-fend-off-depression.html">revealed</a> the mental health benefits of physical movement, be it exercising or even doing chores around the house. I&#8217;ve personally found this to carry over to my own experience of leadership anxiety.</p>



<p>May I ask <em>you</em>: What is your version of &#8220;The Walk&#8221; you like to do to clear your head? And how can you do it more often?</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity"/>



<p>In all of these tactics, you&#8217;ll notice one glaring similarity amongst them: They all require <strong>pause</strong>. A pause in what we&#8217;re doing, in how we&#8217;re thinking. We literally must stop and slow down as a leader, if we are to truly lead well when we&#8217;re experiencing leadership anxiety.</p>



<p>This can feel awfully counterintuitive. We naturally want to immediately &#8220;fix&#8221; something if we feel it&#8217;s wrong – we&#8217;re eager to keep pressing on, being relentless in our actions, so we can find the &#8220;fix&#8221; to our leadership anxiety.</p>



<p>But the &#8220;fix&#8221; we&#8217;re searching for can only be found if we pause. If we stop where we are, what we&#8217;re doing, and do The Check-in, The Quack, and The Walk to find our path forward.</p>



<p>Only then will we be leading our team up and out of the leadership anxiety we&#8217;re experiencing.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-as-daunting-as-it-can-seem-here-s-how-to-manage-former-peers-that-can-perpetuate-a-healthy-team-dynamic">As daunting as it can seem, here&#8217;s how to manage former peers that can perpetuate a healthy team dynamic.</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="337" src="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/former-peers-1024x337.png" alt="how to manage former peers" class="wp-image-6980"/></figure>



<p>With your new promotion, congratulations are in order. But so is trepidation: You are now faced with the precarious challenge of figuring out how to manage former peers.</p>



<p>I can feel the heat rising from your situation in merely <em>thinking</em> about it. Perhaps some of your former peers were vying for the role that you now hold. You&#8217;re concerned that they&#8217;ll be ambivalent in their work&nbsp;– or that folks might even try to undermine you right out of the gate. Gaining their support (let alone the rest of the team&#8217;s!) feels dubious.</p>



<p>What a precarious challenge, indeed!</p>



<p>Despite the delicate nature of your team dynamics, there <em>is</em> a way for you, as a <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2019/12/12/6-mistakes-to-avoid-during-your-first-30-days-as-a-new-manager/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">new manager</a>, to create an environment where your team feels encouraged and energized for the work ahead – rather than defeated or threatened.</p>



<p>Here are two key areas I recommend considering <em>first </em>for how to manage former peers…</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-you-ll-be-tempted-to-overlook-the-one-on-one-meeting-don-t">You&#8217;ll be tempted to overlook the one-on-one meeting. Don&#8217;t.</h2>



<p>Do you feel the spotlight on you? As new managers, our attention often becomes heightened in moments when we feel all eyes are on us. We watch our own words and actions more carefully when we know we&#8217;re being watched. As a result, our <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2019/06/27/what-to-put-on-your-team-meeting-agenda/">all-team meetings</a>, staff meetings, and project meetings (i.e., meetings where the <em>whole</em> team is there) are the moments we tend to pay a lot of care and attention to and prepare extensively ahead of time.</p>



<p>However, in how to manage former peers, we often forget that the moments of 1:1 connection – our one-on-one meetings – are when the spotlight shines the brightest. Especially as a new manager, our former peer will be extra keen to understand how you will be approaching your new role. They&#8217;ll be looking to see your tone, your presumptions – and will be basing their own tone and assumptions off of yours. And they&#8217;ll be looking for this during the one-on-one meeting.</p>



<p>For example, if you&#8217;re smug, vague, and ill-prepared for your one-on-one meetings, you can only imagine how a former peer might feel discouraged and even bitter that you are in this role.</p>



<p>Conversely, if you come to the one-on-one meeting with humility, openness to wanting to support your former peer, and are prepared with specific questions, your former peer will likely leave that one-on-one meeting feeling content and excited about you being in this new role.</p>



<p>Specifically, when it comes to how to manage former peers, here&#8217;s how you might structure the agenda of your first one-on-one meeting with a former peer:</p>



<p><em><strong>Intro</strong></em></p>



<ul><li><em>Share gratitude. Thank them for taking the time to meet with you.</em></li></ul>



<p><em><strong>Share your purpose + ask for help</strong></em></p>



<ul><li><em>You view your true purpose in your new role as to support them.</em></li><li><em>You will rely on them to help you make decisions that benefit the team – and you&#8217;ll need their expertise and input.</em></li></ul>



<p><em><strong>Ask for feedback + initial thoughts</strong></em></p>



<ul><li><em>What do you hope stays the same about the team, going forward?</em></li><li><em>What do you hope changes / gets better in the team, going forward?</em></li><li><em>Anything about the team&#8217;s future that feels worrisome or uncertain for you?</em></li><li><em>What is something we&#8217;ve stalled for too long as a team, and should take immediate action on?</em></li><li><em>What can I change and adjust about my working style to ensure we have a positive working relationship?</em></li><li><em>In previously working together, what&#8217;s one area of development and growth you think I might look to focus on, for myself?</em></li></ul>



<p><em><strong>Closing</strong></em></p>



<ul><li><em>Reiterate gratitude.</em></li><li><em>Share next steps and takeaways.</em></li></ul>

<p>In short, you want to lead with humility and indicate that you don&#8217;t think any more highly of yourself now that you&#8217;re in this role. This will help your former peers be excited to collaborate with you, rather than be wary of you and the new power dynamic.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-you-ll-be-judged-for-what-you-do-not-what-you-say">You&#8217;ll be judged for what you do, not what you say.</h2>



<p>Words can be empty. Action is where true leadership lies. This is of course applicable to all leaders – but when it comes to how to manage former peers, it&#8217;s particularly salient. Your team will be most sensitive to what action you&#8217;re following through on now, more than ever, as it&#8217;s the most reliable proxy they have for your true intentions as a leader.</p>



<p>This means holding one-on-one meetings regularly and consistently every week or every other week, rather than thinking the <em>first</em> one-on-one meeting will suffice to best support your team.</p>



<p>This means asking for feedback when a tough decision is made&nbsp;– or even better, asking for feedback <em>before</em> the decision is made&nbsp;– rather than assuming only asking for feedback during one-on-one meetings covers your bases.</p>



<p>This means knocking out small wins when you see them: Are folks burnt out on Zoom meetings? Cancel a few recurring meetings in the week, or record them so folks can watch at a later time and not feel required to show up. It&#8217;s the little things that add up over time that can make a real difference.</p>



<p>Not sure exactly what the best ways you can be taking action as a leader? Start by asking your team questions about their work preferences, to learn what action you might begin to take.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity"/>



<p>With all of these recommendations for how to manage former peers, you&#8217;ll notice that none of them include any rousing inspirational speech, nor any bold action or triumphant project right off the bat. The truly resonant actions are small: (1) Focus on one-on-one meetings, and (2) Focus on your actions and follow-through as a leader.</p>



<p>With these fundamental practices, you&#8217;ll show how dedicated you are to uplifting your team – and the likelihood of potential drama of &#8220;oh we used to be peers&#8221; fading away will increase.</p>



<p>Focus on these fundamentals. And soon, you&#8217;ll feel firmer in your footing as a new manager of former peers.</p>

As a manager, here are a few things to consider.</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="429" src="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/political-conversation-in-workplace-1024x429.jpg" alt="Political conversation in the workplace" class="wp-image-6936"/></figure>



<p>There&#8217;s been much talk about the degree to which political conversation in the workplace should happen.</p>



<p>Most recently, opinions have been spurred by Basecamp&#8217;s&nbsp;<a href="https://world.hey.com/jason/changes-at-basecamp-7f32afc5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement</a>&nbsp;of their new company policies – the most controversial of which they are asking employees to not engage in political discussions at work.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>(Full disclosure, we, as <a href="https://knowyourteam.com">Know Your Team</a>, are a&nbsp;</em><a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/story" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>spin-off</em></a><em>&nbsp;of Basecamp back in 2014, and Basecamp holds minority ownership in KYT to this day.)<br></em><br><strong>The instinct to want to shut down political conversation is, admittedly, natural.&nbsp;</strong>Discussing politics&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;exhausting – irrespective of if it&#8217;s at work, at home, over dinner, via the phone. Personally, I can barely handle watching the talking heads on the news yell at each other, let alone engage in conversation with a dear family member whose source of facts is so different from mine that I cannot foresee any possible convergence on the horizon line.</p>



<p>Furthermore, as a CEO, executive, or manager in the context of an organization whose purpose is to try to get work done and make progress toward an outcome – it can feel perilously distracting. You may feel you&#8217;re playing the role of a therapist in your one-on-one meetings or wondering to what degree of activism your team or your company should be playing.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s tempting to want to turn it all off. To say, &#8220;<em>Feel free to have these conversations on your own time, in your own private life, but not here – they&#8217;re dragging down the company.</em>&#8220;</p>



<p><strong>However, rarely does the <em>shutting down</em> of energy result in the felt, relieving experience of a <em>release</em> of energy.</strong> In fact, the opposite.  Stifled feels, well, stifled. Our intention to unburden ourselves, in fact, can create a greater burden for our team in the effort they must now put in to avoid sharing a part of themselves and their lives. Leaders cannot extricate what the team feels is inextricably linked:  our political lives and our work lives.</p>



<p>Saying &#8220;<em>don&#8217;t talk about this&#8230;</em>&#8221; doesn&#8217;t lighten the load – it increases it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It doesn&#8217;t have to be this way.</p>



<p><strong>While uncomfortable and arduous, I do believe it is possible for leaders to hold space for civil political discourse in their own team.</strong>&nbsp;Yes, it takes effort. And yes, outcomes may vary depending on your context.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, the reality is that there is no other reality. Political events and ideas affect the day-to-day lives of our team members&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;our customers, whether that experience for you or them is pleasant or not, and whether that experience is the same for you as it is for them.</p>



<p>To&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;consider politics is to ignore one of the many dimensions influencing the context we&#8217;re given to lead. After all, as a leader, considering the many factors in our context – be it the market, our competitors, our customers, our board members, our partners, our employees – is essential to us leading well. Politics is part of that context.</p>



<p>Does this mean that everyone on your team needs to advocate for certain political candidates, or that everyone should divulge where they stand on every political issue? By all means, no. One extreme does not have to replace another.</p>



<p>An alternative path exists. Below, I share a few ideas on how we as leaders can answer the question, &#8220;How political should I let my team be?&#8221; for ourselves – and what exactly we can do about it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-first-root-yourself-in-your-organization-s-vision">First, root yourself in your organization&#8217;s vision.</h3>



<p>When we consider the question, &#8220;<em>How political should I let my team be?</em>&#8221; one of the first roadblocks we as leaders can get tripped up on is, &#8220;<em>I feel that political discussion is a distraction</em>.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a fair sentiment, as it can feel initially distracting&#8230; But, as leaders, we must consider our broader aim of the&nbsp;<a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2017/07/25/what-is-company-vision-a-picture-of-a-better-place/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vision</a>&nbsp;we aspire to – and the degree to which that politics is relevant, involved, or influences that vision.</p>



<p><strong>Ask yourself: &#8220;In what way does my team aspires to better the world? To what degree is that world influenced by politics?&#8221;</strong>&nbsp;Be honest with yourself. For us here at KYT, our vision is a world where bad leaders are the exception and not the norm. That world includes a world where political events and ideas affect employees and managers – and so we, as KYT, try to help leaders navigate how to talk about touchy, political topics with their team (hence, this blog post!). We acknowledge that our vision is inextricably tied to the political realities that the managers we serve are facing. As a result, we commit to enabling civil political discourse, internally, as a team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In another vein, large corporations such as Amazon, Google, Netflix, and Starbucks most recently&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/14/business/ceos-corporate-america-voting-rights.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">voiced their support to protect voting rights</a>, in light of the recent legislative efforts to enact new election requirements. Those corporations have a vision of how they&#8217;re bettering the world, and they believe that engaging on this specific political topic affects the better world they are trying to create.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For yourself:&nbsp; While you may not be a leader at a large corporation, and while perhaps your organizational vision doesn&#8217;t directly interact with political realities as much as we do here at KYT – you can still ask yourself the question, &#8220;<em>To what degree is the vision we&#8217;re aspiring toward affected by politics?</em>&#8221; to observe the connection that appears.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From this frame, you can gauge for yourself whether political discourse in the workplace, while difficult and time-consuming, is inseparably tied to the vision of your organization – rather than obscuring it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-second-don-t-assume-uniformity-invite-alternative-opinions">Second, don&#8217;t assume uniformity + invite alternative opinions.</h3>



<p>When engaging in political conversation in the workplace, it can be easy to assume that everyone has similar opinions – and that everyone&nbsp;<em>wants</em>&nbsp;to weigh in. Remove those assumptions, as they can pressure folks into feeling that they can&#8217;t be authentic to their own political ideas and viewpoints.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, if there is a political issue or event you want to share and discuss, make it clear that you don&#8217;t assume everyone will agree with you, and are not asking them to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, if you&#8217;re sending an article about a political event, consider writing something like one of the statements below, accompanying a link to an article:</p>



<ul><li>&#8220;<em>I feel ___ about this, and it&#8217;s affecting my energy at the moment. I don&#8217;t know if any of you have been following this, but I&#8217;d be happy to share and listen to the different reactions to this event.&#8221;</em></li><li>&#8220;<em>I believe ___, but by no means assume that everyone here feels the exact same way. If it&#8217;s at all useful, I&#8217;d love to have an exchange of ideas on this topic, at some point in the future.&#8221;</em></li></ul>



<p>You can also invite alternative opinions and proactively ask if folks feel uncomfortable from any political conversation in the workplace. This is particularly salient if the company decides it wants to share a message or point-of-view publicly on a political issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, in the wake of the murders of Asian women in Atlanta, I asked our team here at KYT (1) if us sharing a point-of-view on the event would be helpful to our managers that we serve, (2) if they would be open to me writing a&nbsp;<a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2021/03/29/stop-asian-hate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a>&nbsp;on my personal reaction, and (3) if yes, what we as a team want to communicate in the message.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Looking back, I feel that I could&#8217;ve even gone&nbsp;<em>further</em>&nbsp;in inviting conversation around our team&#8217;s different reactions to the event. For instance, questions I will be sure to ask going forward are:</p>



<ul><li><em>To what degree do we feel comfortable voicing a point-of-view on this event?</em></li><li><em>Is voicing an opinion on this event in line with our vision for how we want to help our customers?</em></li><li><em>What part(s) of the message draft that I shared does not quite sit right with you?</em></li><li><em>What part(s) of the message draft can we re-word to more accurately reflect our views as a whole?</em></li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-third-avoid-demonizing-while-disagreeing">Third, avoid demonizing while disagreeing.</h3>



<p>Our reaction to our colleagues can set the tone for whether political conversation in the workplace is additive. This means avoiding attacking someone when their viewpoint does not line up with yours – and ensuring that your direct reports do not demonize their coworkers either.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Make it clear to your team that, if folks disagree on a political issue or idea, both people can simply say,&nbsp;<strong>&#8220;I disagree but respect you and your opinion&#8221;</strong>&nbsp;– and above all, the workplace should be an inclusive, safe place to have hard discussions without castigating others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In practice, this is, of course, difficult. But even explicitly stating to your team that they can use that phrase without harm – &#8220;<em>I disagree but respect you and your opinion</em>&#8221; – can give permission for the discourse to truly be civil.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>Let me be clear: This is not an infallible playbook for ideological harmony.&nbsp; Nor is it a silver bullet for drama-free, conflict-free workplaces.</p>



<p>Rather, it&#8217;s an attempt to share how two seemingly disparate ideas – &#8220;social and political realities affect our work lives&#8221; and &#8220;the #1 purpose of an organization is to make progress toward an outcome that couldn&#8217;t be accomplished on one&#8217;s own&#8221; – are not mutually exclusive. They are bound together. Politics are ingrained in the context of our lives, and as leaders, we have to integrate rather than ignore.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As leadership professor Gianpiero Petriglieri eloquently&nbsp;<a href="https://qz.com/work/1936056/should-management-be-political-that-is-the-wrong-question/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posed</a>, &#8220;How political should I let my team be?&#8221; might be the wrong question altogether. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Rather, we should ask:&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&#8220;How&nbsp;</strong><strong><em>well</em></strong><strong>&nbsp;will I enable civil political discourse in my own team?&#8221;</strong></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-the-wake-of-the-murders-of-asian-women-we-as-leaders-have-agency-and-leverage-to-stop-hate">In the wake of the murders of Asian women, we as leaders have agency and leverage to stop hate.</h2>



<p>&#8220;How are you doing lately, Claire?&#8221;</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve been asked this over calls and in meetings over the past 13 days.</p>



<p>Quite honestly, I have not been doing well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the wake of the murders of Asian women on March 16th, I&#8217;ve been reliving every racist experience I&#8217;ve had in my 32 years of life as an Asian woman.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The hyper-sexualization and fetishization of Asian women have been ever-present in my life as an Asian woman – and ever-present in our American history for as long as Asians first immigrated to this country more than a century ago. It has dehumanized me and so many other countless Asian women, to this day in 2021.</p>



<p>It is not harmless – it is racist oppression. Most tragically and disgustingly, it led to the targeted murders of Asian women last week in Atlanta, the city where I was born. When the killer&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/03/17/us/shooting-atlanta-acworth" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told</a>&nbsp;the police he had a &#8220;sexual addiction&#8221; and carried out the murders to eliminate &#8220;a temptation,&#8221; he was referencing a stereotype that dehumanizes and fetishizes Asian women. He wanted to eliminate people who look like&nbsp;<em>me</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When will it stop?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hate-stops-when-we-choose-to-stop-it"><strong>Hate stops when we choose to stop it.&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Together, as a community, we can take small actions and speak up toward family members, toward our colleagues. We can bring awareness to the anti-Asian hate that exists and root it out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As leaders, we have agency and leverage to stop hate – perhaps more than we even know. After all, our singular aim as a leader is to create an environment where our team can do their best work. An environment where our team feels safe, valued, and respected. An environment where racism is indubitably repudiated. An environment where reflection, compassion, and inclusivity are encouraged.</p>



<p>Will you join me in working to create this kind of environment in your own team?</p>



<p>I write to you, as an Asian woman CEO, to ask us all to consider how our stereotypes, our jokes, our prejudices against Asians contribute to hate in our world. Join me in considering on what we can do to show greater respect for Asian people, and publicly condemn hate so it no longer can exist.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Specifically&#8230;</p>



<p><strong>If you are a CEO or a manager in your organization</strong>,<strong>&nbsp;write a message or share a few words during your next team meeting.</strong>&nbsp;Make clear that Asian hate is not tolerated. Don&#8217;t worry that it&#8217;s &#8220;too late&#8221; or you didn&#8217;t react quick enough to when the hate crime occurred. Now is better than never. Be vocal, whether it&#8217;s publicly or internally, that you stand with the Asian community.</p>



<p><strong>If you have Asian employees and coworkers, check-in on them in a sincere way</strong>. Send them a text message or a call, and let them know how horrified you are by the murders. Assure them it is safe to grieve, to share the racism they&#8217;ve experienced. Express how much you admire them, care about them, and support them.</p>



<p><strong>In your own neighborhood, please look out for your fellow Asian neighbors, friends, and community members</strong>&nbsp;– particularly those who are elderly or live alone. Disturbingly, anti-Asian hate crimes&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/anti-asian-hate-crimes-increased-nearly-150-2020-mostly-n-n1260264" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increased</a>&nbsp;150% in 2020, while the overall hate crime rates have declined.</p>



<p><strong>If you&#8217;re looking to educate yourself on the history of anti-Asian violence in America and the Asian-American identity and experience, here are some resources</strong>&#8230;.</p>

<p><strong>If you are reading this and you are Asian, know this: It is okay to not be &#8220;okay.&#8221;</strong> Self-compassion is an act of resistance. You are allowed to grieve. You are allowed to let yourself feel trauma. You are allowed to be angry. We see you. We embrace you. We stand with you. We are in this together. </p>



<p>The darkness of hate can feel bleak and overwhelming – but together, through our actions and words, we can shine a light to overcome it.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-here-are-the-7-topics-and-5-formats-your-remote-leadership-training-should-include-for-your-new-managers">Here are the 7 topics and 5 formats your remote leadership training should include for your new managers.</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="429" src="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/remote-training-2-1024x429.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6813"/></figure>



<p>&#8220;What should I consider for remote leadership training in my company?&#8221;</p>



<p>Recently, I was asked this question by a CEO.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a question many CEOs, VPs of People and Culture, and CHROs have been asking themselves lately. We&#8217;ve all witnessed over the past year our managers transition to remote work – albeit with herculean effort and oftentimes varying results. Looking ahead to 2021, we want to find greater ways to support our managers (especially new managers) from afar.</p>



<p>When it comes to remote leadership training, the immediate instinct is to default to some kind of online video course, such as Skillshare or Udemy or Linkedin Learning. Or, to convert your monthly three-hour leadership training sessions into Zoom meetings for your managers.</p>



<p>While these paths are valuable (we in fact have a <a href="https://www.skillshare.com/classes/Modern-Leadership-Give-Get-Honest-Feedback-at-Work/1538913998">course on Skillshare,</a> ourselves!), the reality is that most remote leadership training is a single dose of learning –&nbsp;a one-time deposit of information that is helpful in-the-moment but rarely remembered past the duration of the online course or session itself, let alone applied in a real-life situation.</p>



<p>Consider ceramics. Watching an online Youtube video course is super helpful as an initial primer on, say, learning about ceramics. But if you want to truly become proficient throwing on a potter&#8217;s wheel, you&#8217;ll want other forms of learning. You&#8217;ll sign-up for a class where you can learn how to wedge your clay, center it, etc.</p>



<p>You want learning that is more ongoing, hands-on. Learning where you can truly practice.</p>



<p>So then, what is the leadership equivalent?</p>



<p>Below, I share what to consider when designing your remote leadership training for your managers, so you can best support them in the upcoming year in a continual, engaging way. <strong>I cover two aspects of the ideal remote leadership training program: (1) The best format and (2) The best topics.</strong></p>



<p>Read on to learn more.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-format-should-i-use-for-remote-leadership-training">What format should I use for remote leadership training?</h2>



<p>There is <em>no one single best format</em>. This may seem like a non-answer but bear with me. Rather, <strong>the best format for learning in a remote environment is offering rich, varied opportunities for learning.</strong> The more opportunities, the better. This enables your managers to choose what format works best for them (using video, written materials, using a tool) – and encourages them to switch between formats to keep things engaging for them. Know that some people will gravitate to some formats more than others&nbsp;– and that&#8217;s the point <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> To give optionality.</p>



<p>Here are the different types of formats you&#8217;ll want to consider incorporating into your remote leadership training:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-research-backed-written-material">Research-backed written material. </h3>



<p>Some direct sources of written leadership material that I personally frequent and cite on this blog include Harvard Business Review, McKinsey Quarterly, Strategy+Business, MIT Sloan Management Review, and Gallup. You may want to subscribe your leaders to some of these materials or curate articles and link to them as part of your remote leadership training. You can also utilize our <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/guides/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">Guides in Know Your Team</a> which cite and condense much of this leadership research.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-live-or-recorded-video-lessons-to-watch-on-their-own-time">Live or recorded video lessons to watch on their own time. </h3>



<p>The most popular formats include Skillshare, Udemy, Coursera, and Linkedin Learning. (Note, I have <em>not</em> watched all of these modules myself. I simply share them as a point of reference). We also host <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/workshops/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">Workshop Live! sessions in Know Your Team</a> that you&#8217;re able to watch the recordings of, or attend live. Here&#8217;s a <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/managing_remote_teams_workshop/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">sample one</a>. You can <a href="http://knowyourteam.com/m/features/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">sign-up for Know Your Team</a> to learn more.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-manager-peer-groups">Manager peer groups. </h3>



<p>Learning by experience is enhanced when you can learn from the experience of <em>others</em>. Leadership is no different. This could be done with monthly Zoom calls on a certain topic (e.g., &#8220;improving morale&#8221; or &#8220;giving feedback&#8221;) or a private Slack channel where managers can share tips and celebrate small wins. Other organizations will have a buddy system for their managers where senior managers can mentor new managers once a month during a one-hour call. In Know Your Team, we try to evoke the feeling of a global manager peer group with our online manager community, <a href="http://knowyourteam.com/m/features/community/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">The Watercooler</a>. Membership to it is included when you subscribe to <a href="http://knowyourteam.com/m/features/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">Know Your Team</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lightweight-manager-tools">Lightweight manager tools.</h3>



<p>Perhaps the best proxy for the &#8220;in-person, live ceramics class&#8221; is to give your manager tools that they can use themselves, to reinforce what they&#8217;re learning. Specifically, tools that help them run more effective one-on-one meetings, build rapport with their remote team, and help their team track progress. This is in fact exactly what Know Your Team provides <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Your managers can use our <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/one_on_ones/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">One-on-Ones Tool</a>, <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/social_questions/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">Social Questions</a>, and <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/heartbeats/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">Heartbeat Check-in</a> to help guide their actions as a leader.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-1-remote-coaching">1:1 remote coaching. </h3>



<p>Having your managers work with an executive coach can be a useful as a part of a remote leadership training program when deployed prudently. For example, if you have a leadership coach who can provide &#8220;office hours&#8221; for your managers to sign-up for a 30-minute slot, they can serve as a helpful spot-check and counsel on tough issues. However, keep in mind that a leadership coach is most effective when (1) there is an in-depth, ongoing relationship that can be built over time so the coach has maximum context for their client&#8217;s situation and (2) the leader who is the client is typically a more senior leader, rather than a new manager. This way they have adequate experience to be able to contextualize the counsel they&#8217;re given. Executive coaching isn&#8217;t worth the high cost, otherwise.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-are-the-most-critical-topics-that-remote-leadership-training-should-cover">What are the most critical topics that remote leadership training should cover?</h2>



<p>Here are the most fundamental areas that you&#8217;ll want to make sure your remote leadership training includes:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-clear-definition-of-success">A clear definition of success. </h3>



<p>It&#8217;s hard to help your managers become good managers if you don&#8217;t clearly define what a &#8220;good&#8221; manager is in the first place. A precise definition of the purpose of a leader, what an effective leader does, and the mindset shift that&#8217;s required. You can read a bit about how to frame what a successful leader does in these pieces:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2019/01/15/how-to-become-a-good-new-manager/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">The Mindset Shift</a></li><li><a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2017/12/01/the-10-qualities-of-a-true-leader/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">The 10 Qualities of a Good Leader</a></li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-build-trust-in-a-remote-team">How to build trust in a remote team. </h3>



<p>Trust is the oil of a team. Without it, especially in a remote team where you&#8217;re not interacting face-to-face, it can make working together have more friction than required. You&#8217;ll want to teach through your remote leadership training how to focus on building rapport and strong one-to-one relationships in a remote environment. This means encouraging your managers to be vulnerable as leaders, sharing personal views and hobbies, coming from a genuine place in wanting to get to know the team better, and following through on their commitments as a leader so their team knows that they can rely on them. You can read more about building trust remotely in these pieces:</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-give-critical-feedback-remotely">How to give critical feedback remotely. </h3>



<p>Giving difficult feedback to team members is one of the most frequently utilized skills &#8211;&nbsp;and most notoriously&nbsp;difficult. It&#8217;s even tougher to do well in a remote environment, where a manager cannot directly read the other person&#8217;s body language. The key is to give your managers a framework in your remote leadership training for how to best give feedback, so they&#8217;re not sugar-coating their feedback or being too brusque in their delivery. For instance, share a framework that focuses on sharing the intention of the feedback and stressing specific observable behaviors, so that their employees are more likely to internalize that feedback and change their behavior. Our recommended framework for giving feedback remotely can be found here:</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-best-coach-employees-remotely-particularly-if-they-re-underperforming">How to best coach employees remotely (particularly if they&#8217;re underperforming). </h3>



<p>What happens if someone in the team is falling behind? It can happen even in the best of teams, and some employees can be more susceptible to lagging performance in a remote environment if they haven&#8217;t been properly coached. As a manager, it&#8217;s hard to know if a direct report&#8217;s poor performance is due to something in their home life that&#8217;s weighing them down, or if it&#8217;s due to a lack of clear deliverables… Either way, you want to equip your managers with a toolkit for how to handle this situation. Here are our recommendations for how to best coach an underperforming remote employee. You can also have your managers <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/one_on_ones/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">use our One-on-ones Tool in Know Your Team</a> to facilitate these coaching conversations.

<p>Communicating in a remote team does not have to feel like turning on a firehouse, with pings and chats and video calls incessantly all day, every day. Know that does not have to be the norm in a remote work environment, and you can help your managers avoid this reality by teaching best practices for communicating in a remote team. For instance, you can recommend that they have some sort of &#8220;Communication Cheat Sheet&#8221; and rely more heavily on asynchronous writing. You can read more about the best practices for remote communication in a team here:</p>

<p>With everyone in a team remote, your managers&#8217; one-on-one meetings with their direct reports become paramount. With casual coffee meetings and spontaneous conversations &#8220;swinging by someone&#8217;s desk&#8221; now relics of the past, the remote one-on-one meeting is truly the only opportunity for a manager to have 1:1 interaction with a direct report. As a result, teaching a manager how to hold an effective one-on-one meeting is critical. In KYT, we wrote a <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/guides/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">Guide to Effective One-on-One Meetings</a> that your managers can access, along with a <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/one_on_ones/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">One-on-Ones Tool</a> that helps a manager take what their learning and put it into practice.

<p>At the end of the day, employees will be looking to their manager for guidance: &#8220;Where is the team headed? Why is that important? And how is each person&#8217;s work rolling up to that bigger picture of what the team is trying to accomplish?&#8221; Thus, your managers will need to understand how to co-create vision in their team, and help their team make progress toward that vision.

<p>As you build out your remote leadership training program, revisit these recommendations: (1) The format of the leadership training program should involve a variety of ways to engage your managers to maximize learning, and (2) The content of your leadership training should encompass the 7 topics listed above. In a remote work environment, the success of your team is contingent on the success of your managers. Perhaps a fresh, multi-faceted approach, as the one described here, is well worth the time to consider.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-here-are-the-most-imperative-and-most-overlooked-communication-best-practices-for-remote-teams">Here are the most imperative –&nbsp;and most overlooked – communication best practices for remote teams. </h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="429" src="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/remote-communication-1024x429.png" alt="Communication best practices for remote teams" class="wp-image-6707"/></figure>



<p>An endless barrage of Zoom meetings.  Non-stop Slack pings. This is your new normal, and it feels bleak. You think to yourself:  &#8220;Communication best practices for remote teams <em>must </em>exist&#8230;right?&#8221;</p>



<p>You&#8217;re having a hard time imagining the way you&#8217;re communicating remotely right now is the way you <em>want</em> to continue to communicate at work. You&#8217;re drained working remotely, more than you were when you were working in-person&nbsp;– and your team is too. </p>



<p>As we dig our heels into remote work for the foreseeable future, naturally, we ask ourselves:  Is there a better way for working remotely?  What are the exact communication best practices for remote teams? </p>



<p>Communicating in a remote work environment doesn&#8217;t have to feel as all-consuming and frazzled as it does today. Processes and communication in remote teams can be sustainable and well-thought-out – not merely hurried and duct-taped together.</p>



<p>Based on our <a href="http://knowyourteam.com/m/lessons/161-managing-remote-teams/topics/1301-intro-managing-remote-teams/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">survey with 297 remote managers and employees</a>,  insights from working with 15,000+ people in over 25 countries with <a href="http://knowyourteam.com/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=inline_link">Know Your Team</a>, and the research we’ve done across dozens of remote companies, I share the most essential communication best practices for remote teams below.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-default-to-asynchronous-writing">#1:  Default to asynchronous writing.</h2>



<p>If a remote work cardinal sin exists, it&#8217;s relying on real-time communication.</p>



<p>How do you know if you&#8217;re under siege by real-time communication?  If your Slack app looks something like this…</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" width="249" height="226" src="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/slack-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6694"/><figcaption><em>via Google Images</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Or if your calendar looks something like this with Zoom meetings…</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/calendar-2-1024x702.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6695" width="512" height="351"/><figcaption><em>via Google Images</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>…You&#8217;re likely an offender <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />  </p>



<p>To free you and your team from the oppression of real-time communication, default to asynchronous communication. The most effective remote teams do so, utilizing asynchronous <em>writing</em> in particular as their primary mode of communication. </p>



<p>This means you writing down your message to give your team time to digest your note and respond to you thoughtfully a few hours later &nbsp;– instead of firing off a chat to someone via Slack or Microsoft Teams and adding to their infinite queue of chats. </p>



<p>Or, rather than holding a Google Hangout to ask questions about a project and eating up a whole hour of your team&#8217;s time, you write-up a project online, share it via email, and have folks respond the next day with a full 24-hours  to digest the contents.</p>



<p>The advantages of writing asynchronously are copious:</p>



<ul><li><strong>You give your team time to triage. </strong>All messages are not created equal, and your team can now prioritize, work on, and respond to the messages that are most important, and not just most recent.</li><li><strong>You give your team time to think.</strong> Communication is no longer a firehouse, so your team can now ruminate deeply on complex issues and problem solve in a more thorough way. </li><li><strong>You make it easier to share information. </strong>Because you&#8217;re converting meetings into online documents, each recorded document now has a URL that you can share with anyone else in the organization. Transparency multiplies.</li></ul>

<p>Making the switch to writing asynchronously can feel daunting. (Where to start first?&#8221; you may be wondering. Your transition to asynchronous writing does not have to be a waterfall – but a slow drip. Begin with a single moment of real-time communication and see if you can convert it into asynchronous writing. For example:</p>



<ul><li>Instead of holding an announcement meeting online&#8230; <strong>Write up a team-wide memo </strong>sharing the announcement and/or record a video of you personally making the announcement that people can watch on their own time.</li><li>Instead of holding a project kick-off meeting online&#8230; <strong>Write a long-form message</strong> that outlines how the project should start off.</li><li>Instead of having a decision discussion in a meeting online&#8230; <strong>Write a long-form message</strong> that delineates the main trade-offs of the decision, first.</li><li>Instead of brainstorming ideas in a meeting online&#8230; <strong>Write a long-form message</strong> that initiates a list of ideas you have, first.</li><li>Instead of asking a question via online chat&#8230; <strong>Write a message that asks the question</strong> that the other person can answer a few hours later, or within the next few days. </li></ul>



<p><em>PS:  To house these asynchronous messages, we here at KYT use <a href="https://basecamp.com">Basecamp</a> – a project management tool – to have a committed, organized place for all our asynchronous writing. But other tools remote managers use for asynchronous writing include Asana, Confluence, email (of course!), GetGuru, Google Docs, Notion, Smartsheets, Threads, Trello, and Twist.</em></p>



<p>Give asynchronous writing a shot. If there is one practice out of all the communication best practices for remote teams to try, it is this one. You&#8217;ll move toward cultivating a less reactive culture where your team can make more thoughtful decisions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-match-the-message-to-the-channel">#2:  Match the message to the channel</h2>



<p>Let&#8217;s say you commit to writing asynchronously as your default mode of communication in your remote team. Fantastic! That&#8217;s an excellent first step.</p>



<p>However, not <em>all</em> things you want to communicate can be relegated only to writing. Naturally, you have things you also want to communicate remotely via email, chat, video call, phone call. A strategic planning conversation or a time-sensitive question requires real-time communication. </p>



<p><strong>When you do need to use real-time communication, you&#8217;ll want to have a method to your madness. One method is what I call, &#8220;matching the message to the channel.&#8221;</strong> This simply means that all messages are delineated specific channels, based on their importance or urgency. <a href="http://gitlab.com">GitLab</a>, a remote company with 700+ people, perhaps espouses this better than anyone. In their <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2015/04/08/the-remote-manifesto/">remote manifesto</a>, they write: “Choose the right channel of communication according to the necessity of the task you’re working on.”</p>



<p>For instance:  An urgent message that&#8217;s expected to be read and responded to within the hour might be sent via direct message in Slack. A message that is a longer description or project outline might be posted in a certain section in Notion and is only expected to be read within 24 hours. </p>



<p>What&#8217;s helpful about this remote communication best practice is that it means that your team will now know that they should check their Slack DMs likely once an hour, and check Notion once a day&nbsp;– rather than hovering over 10 Slack channels and checking each one every 15 minutes.</p>



<p><strong>As a remote manager, here’s what you need to clarify with your team about to &#8220;match the message with the channel&#8221;:</strong></p>



<ul><li><em>What’s the default mode of communication? Email? Video call? Chat? Phone call?</em></li><li><em> Which channel/tool should be used for which kind of communication?</em></li><li><em> Who else should be copied on a message, if anyone?</em></li><li><em> When something is urgent, how should it be communicated? What about when it’s not?</em></li><li><em> What’s the right cadence for checking in on a certain communication?</em></li></ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-quiet-is-a-communication-best-practice">#3:  Quiet is a communication best practice.</h2>



<p>The most overlooked remote communication best practice is, well, <em>not</em> communicating. <strong>Silence is golden in a remote team. People need quiet, uninterrupted time to get work done. </strong>That’s how people get into a state of “flow,” which is critical to thinking creatively or generating something from scratch. </p>



<p>Effective remote leaders recognize this, respect this, and encourage this. Paul Farnell, Co-Founder of <a href="https://www.litmus.com/">Litmus</a> (a <a href="http://knowyourteam.com/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=inline_link">Know Your Team</a> customer), emphasized this when he <a href="https://thinkgrowth.org/the-difference-between-remote-and-remote-first-7dd38458855f">wrote</a>:  <em>“It’s more important to give employees quiet time than it is to cram them into an open office.”</em></p>



<p>GitLab, a remote company with 700+ people, similarly values quiet as a communication best practice. In their <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2015/04/08/the-remote-manifesto/">remote manifesto</a>, GitLab shares this gentle reminder: “Can it wait a few minutes, a few hours, even a few days? Don’t take someone from their work if you don’t have to.” They know how precious their team&#8217;s time and attention is – and that communicating 24/7 is not conducive to productivity. </p>



<p>After all, attention is finite. In a remote team, if we want to communicate well, we should be conscious of how our communication pulls people&#8217;s attention in too many disparate directions. Quiet time, as a result, is indeed a communication best practice.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-have-a-how-we-communicate-document">#4:  Have a &#8220;How We Communicate&#8221; document.</h2>



<p>When we work in person and are co-located, communication feels obvious. We know if we need to get a hold of someone how to get a hold of someone. If we need to say something, we say something. </p>



<p>However, when working remotely, things are different.  <strong>Documenting <em>how</em> people should ideally communicate isn&#8217;t just a &#8220;nice-to-have,&#8221; but a cornerstone document to align your staff and help onboard new folks as the company grows.</strong> For some organizations, this comes in the form of a &#8220;How We Communicate&#8221; document, which outlines all communication best practices.</p>



<p><strong>This document should answer questions such as…</strong></p>



<ul><li><em>What time zones are everyone working in? How will this be communicated? </em></li><li><em>What are the expected working hours each person has? What should the overlapping working hours for folks in different time zones be? </em></li><li><em>If you need to be offline to run an errand or are in a meeting, how will that be communicated? </em></li><li><em>How will it be communicated when someone is sick or feeling unwell? </em></li><li><em>Are there any times team members should not be disturbed? </em></li><li><em>What’s the expected response time to messages? Does that vary depending on what the message is, or the channel that it is delivered in? </em></li></ul>



<p>For example, for us here at <a href="http://knowyourteam.com/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=inline_link">Know Your Team</a>, we have a company-wide doc called “<a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2019/08/22/how-to-collaborate-effectively-in-a-remote-team/">How We Work</a>” which outlines what to do if something is urgent, how quickly to expect that someone will get back to you, how to share what you’re working on etc. </p>



<p>Here are some other examples of other companies&#8217; &#8220;How We Communicate&#8221; documents:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://basecamp.com/guides/how-we-communicate">Basecamp’s Guide to Internal Communication</a></li><li><a href="https://open.buffer.com/slack-agreements/">Buffer’s 10 Slack Agreements</a></li><li><a href="http://GitLab's Remote Communication Handbook">GitLab&#8217;s Remote Communication Handbook</a></li><li><a href="https://automattic.com/expectations/">Automattic’s Communication Expectations</a></li></ul>



<p>Or, for something less intensive, you can create a little &#8220;Communication Cheat Sheet&#8221; for folks to reference. This includes tips for your team such as:</p>



<ul><li><em>“If you are going to be offline to take care of some personal things during the day, please notify your direct team on their Slack channel.”</em></li><li><em> “If you are planning to work at odd hours schedule for a few days, please let everybody know up-front.”</em></li></ul>



<p>Keep in mind that you&#8217;re <em>not</em> trying to create a bureaucratic mandate with your &#8220;How to Communicate&#8221; document or a &#8220;Communication Cheat Sheet.&#8221; It should not be so complicated that people spend a ton of time memorizing it, nor should anyone be penalized for making a mistake and not following it. Like any good process, its value comes from its utility and how well it&#8217;s <em>helping </em>your team –&nbsp;not holding your team back.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-emphasize-empathy-in-the-absence-of-in-person-cues">#5: Emphasize empathy, in the absence of in-person cues.</h2>



<p>Someone makes a request that comes across as harsh. Another makes a critique that comes across as insensitive. This no doubt happens with greater frequency in a remote environment, as you can&#8217;t physically hear someone&#8217;s tone of voice or interpret a person&#8217;s facial expression. In fact, in a <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/lessons/161-managing-remote-teams/topics/1301-intro-managing-remote-teams/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">2019 survey</a> we conducted with 297 remote managers and employees, remote managers said that the second hardest thing for them was “communicating without in-person cues” (15% of remote managers said this).</p>



<p>One path to overcoming this obstacle is to <strong>cultivate as many opportunities for you and your team to receive those in-person cues.</strong> Video calls and meetings are ideal for this, as they give you the closest fidelity to being co-located. So rather than writing an email or phoning a colleague, ask if they can hop on a quick video chat. In our online community of leaders in <a href="http://knowyourteam.com/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=inline_link">Know Your Team</a>, one manager mentioned how his team always turns their cameras on for video calls – be it one-on-one meetings, team meetings, discussions, or brainstorm sessions. In our survey, remote managers and employees said that they used video to hold meetings and conversations either several times a week (32%) or every single day (22%).</p>



<p>Additionally, <strong>the lack of nuanced expression in remote communication means that you&#8217;ll want to offer your team more grace and generosity when giving and receiving communications. </strong>If someone’s message comes across as brusque to you, <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2017/12/01/the-power-of-assuming-positive-intent/">assume positive intent</a> behind it. Perhaps they were writing their note to you after a stressful call with a customer. Maybe they&#8217;ve got a kid at home who&#8217;s sick and it&#8217;s been weighing on their mind.</p>



<p>When I interviewed Wade Foster, CEO of <a href="http://zapier.com">Zapier</a>, on our podcast, he echoed this, describing how  hard it is to “read” people in a remote work environment – and how facile it is to assume how someone is feeling. Instead, what Wade tries to account for this by rigorously clarifying his intentions. If he sends a Slack message and wonders if he came across imposingly, he’ll ask, “Ah, did I overstep there?” In other words, he never hesitates to clear the air, seek common ground, and try to ensure he and the other person are on the same page.</p>



<p>Throughout the workday, be it using video more often or assuming greater positive intent in communications, looking to establish more empathy is a key best practice of remote communication.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity"/>



<p>Communication in a remote team doesn’t have to be as overwhelming or all-consuming as it currently exists in your organization. Focus on these five communication best practices for remote teams:</p>



<ol><li>Default to&nbsp;asynchronous writing</li><li>Match the message to the channel</li><li>Have a &#8220;How We Work&#8221; document</li><li>Enabe quiet time </li><li>Emphasize empathy</li></ol>



<p>Enact even <em>one</em> of these practices, and you&#8217;ll find a meaningful shift that occurs in your own remote team. Your remote work environment will feel lighter, more coherent – and perhaps, dare I say even more <em>delightful.</em></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">12 practices for how to build team morale remotely in the long-term, not as a short-term enthusiasm blip.</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="496" src="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/team-morale-remotely-1024x496.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6631"/></figure>



<p>Now, more than ever, the question, &#8220;How to build team morale remotely?&#8221; is one you may be asking yourself.</p>



<p>From your team&#8217;s body language on Zoom calls, you can just tell. Folks look work thin. Energy levels are depleted. And if you let yourself admit it, you feel depleted as well. </p>



<p>You&#8217;re not alone. Thirty-nine percent of managers in a recent <a href="https://canopy.is/m/webinars?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=build-morale-remotely">Canopy Live Event</a> session with hundreds of managers from around the world, described the current level of morale in their team as &#8220;low&#8221; (out of 140 participants in the poll).</p>



<p>These are uncertain times. Amidst the pandemic and US election and everyone now working remotely, a swirl of fear, anxiety, and malaise have seeped into many teams. A heaviness is felt by many.</p>



<p>As a leader, it feels pressing:  You want to turn things around, of course. To lift your team&#8217;s spirits and to figure out how to build team morale remotely.</p>



<p>But how <em>exactly</em>?</p>



<p>Here, I&#8217;ll share some specific practices for how to build team morale remotely, based on research from the past 20 years on morale – along with our own research of working with 15,000+ people over the past 6 years. A heads up that it&#8217;s a long read – but it&#8217;s because I wanted to do this critical topic justice. </p>



<p>Let&#8217;s dive in.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="defining-team-morale">Defining &#8220;team morale&#8221;</h2>



<p>Before talk best practices for how to build team morale remotely, let&#8217;s get clear on what we&#8217;re trying to improve, in the first place.</p>



<p>You can&#8217;t improve what you haven&#8217;t properly identified. As a result, we have to properly define what team morale is, first.</p>



<p>Morale is the outlook and sentiment of your team. It&#8217;s the way people <em>feel</em> about the team and the company. </p>



<p>Morale is <em>not</em> is the engagement of your employees. <a href="https://canopy.is/blog/2019/05/18/the-32-best-employee-engagement-questions/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=build-morale-remotely">Employee engagement</a> is the level of involvement and enthusiasm of your team. Nor is morale equivalent to motivation. After all, <a href="https://canopy.is/blog/2019/09/06/how-to-motivate-employees-dont-do-this-instead/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=build-morale-remotely">motivation</a> is our own drive and willingness we have in the workplace. It&#8217;s our inner impulse that encourages us to do – or not to do – something.</p>



<p>Above all, we must not conflate morale with culture. As organizational scholar <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Organizational-Culture-Leadership-Jossey-Bass-Management/dp/0875896391">Edgar Schein</a> delineated, <a href="https://canopy.is/blog/2018/01/16/the-3-key-elements-of-company-culture-and-why-they-really-matter/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=build-morale-remotely">culture</a> is comprised of artifacts, beliefs and basic underlying assumptions. And while morale absolutely influences these elements and culture as a whole, team morale is a team&#8217;s sentiment – it is not culture, in itself.</p>



<p>To be clear:  Morale <em>impacts</em> engagement, motivation, and culture, but it is <em>not a sole predictor</em> of any of them. </p>



<p>You&#8217;ve likely observed this firsthand. For instance, a team has high morale&nbsp;–but their culture is toxic to outsiders. Or perhaps, a team has low morale –but they have high engagement out of fear of repercussions if they don&#8217;t.</p>



<p>This distinction of morale is massively important. It helps us realize that team morale is only a lever, an input, toward certain outcomes that we want to achieve. This helps us avoid optimizing for the wrong thing.</p>



<p>On its own, high morale doesn&#8217;t get you anywhere. Rather, if we want to improve team morale remotely, that improvement in morale must serve a bigger idea. Perhaps it&#8217;s in service of a healthy culture or in service of hitting annual goals, or in service making progress toward your vision. </p>



<p>Whatever larger purpose that high morale might serve for your team, make sure you&#8217;re clear on it.</p>



<p>Ask yourself:  Why do you need to improve morale?  What is high morale in your team ultimately in service of?</p>



<p>In sum:  Team morale is outlook and sentiment. If you want to improve it, it should be in service of a bigger idea or outcome.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="12-practices-for-how-to-build-team-morale-remotely">12 practices for how to build team morale remotely</h2>



<p>Now that we&#8217;ve honed in on what team morale truly is and how it should serve a greater idea, outcome, or aim, let&#8217;s delve into the best practices for how to build team morale remotely.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">DO NOT: Ask, &#8220;How can I help you?&#8221;</h3>



<p>Bear with me here. You&#8217;re likely thinking, <em>&#8220;What do you mean I shouldn&#8217;t ask, &#8216;How can I help you?&#8217; Isn&#8217;t that a fine, normal question to ask?&#8221;</em> I hear you. Up until a few years ago, I personally found myself asking this question to team members.</p>



<p>Asking &#8220;How can I help you?&#8221; doesn&#8217;t help the other person at all. It burdens them. You&#8217;re asking your direct report to come up with a thoughtful critique and feedback of you and your role on-the-spot. Instead of encouraging positive sentiment by asking that question, you&#8217;re whirring up more stress and more anxiety for your direct report. While your intention may be to help, the question hurts.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">DO: Ask more meaningful, specific questions. </h3>



<p>Instead of reverting to &#8220;How can I help you?&#8221; during a one-on-one meeting, try different questions: Questions that put an employee at ease. Questions that enable them to speak from the heart, to level with you honestly, and share things perhaps that they might not normally share with you.  </p>

</div>
</div>



<p>Specifically, here are some of the best questions to ask if you want to improve team morale remotely:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">&#8220;How would you describe your energy level these days?&#8221;  </h4>



<p>This is a fantastic alternative to asking &#8220;How are you doing?&#8221; and helps to reveal the morale of the person more accurately. Follow-up questions you can ask include:</p>



<ul>
<li>&#8220;Have you been able to take time for yourself, in any way? How can I support you in that?&#8221;</li>



<li>&#8220;Are there any tasks or projects lately that feel more like a struggle than usual? How can I adjust things to help make that project more manageable right now?&#8221;</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">&#8220;What fears or trepidation do you have around the team, and/or company, if any?&#8221;</h4>



<p> This question helps pinpoint what might be causing or triggering the low morale –&nbsp;and help you understand if there&#8217;s anything within your locus of control to fix it. Follow-up questions you can ask include:</p>



<ul>
<li>&#8220;What can we communicate more often and more transparently to help reduce anxiety around X?&#8221;</li>



<li>&#8220;Is our plan for the next 90 days clear?&#8221;</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">&#8220;How have you been feeling about your own performance lately?&#8221; </h4>



<p>When you ask this question, you&#8217;re trying to see if the level of morale a direct report is based on their own perceived performance level. Follow up by asking these questions, as well:</p>



<ul>
<li>&#8220;What are you most worried about getting &#8216;wrong&#8217; with the project?&#8221;</li>



<li>&#8220;In your view, did anything fall short of your own expectations?&#8221;</li>



<li>&#8220;In your view, did anything fall short of the team&#8217;s expectations?&#8221;</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">&#8220;What are your biggest time wasters?&#8221; </h4>



<p>If you&#8217;re trying to figure out how to build team morale remotely, this question can help identify blockers for your direct report – blockers that you can potentially eliminate to help improve morale.  Follow-up by asking these questions as well:</p>



<ul>
<li>&#8220;How am I or others holding up progress for you?&#8221;</li>



<li>&#8220;What have you seen in the team that could accelerate our progress?&#8221;</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">DO NOT:  Require participation in team-building and social activities. </h3>



<p>When we feel team morale is low, we often seek out social engagements as a solution.&nbsp;But it&#8217;s hard to &#8220;rally the troops&#8221; so-to-speak when everyone is working remotely.
Particularly if it&#8217;s required. </p>



<p>Make anything required and it automatically becomes dreaded. This is a funny part of our human psychology that we resist the things that are imposed upon us. </p>



<p>Additionally, when we default to stacking Zoom social events on the calendar as a way for how to build team morale remotely, we assume because it&#8217;s something <em>we</em> like that others will enjoy it. </p>



<p>This is a grave mistake. Because while of course, <em>you</em> might enjoy it, the truth is this:  Other people are not you <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>Think of it this way:  Rather than employ the Golden Rule of &#8220;treat others the way you want to be treated,&#8221; try the Silver Rule:  &#8220;Treat others the way <em>they</em> want to be treated.&#8221;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">DO:  Figure out work preferences. </h3>



<p>To put the Silver Rule to work, you&#8217;ll want to figure out, well, what <em>others</em> truly like.</p>



<p>I call these &#8220;<a href="https://canopy.is/blog/2020/09/14/the-13-best-questions-to-ask-during-the-remote-onboarding-process/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=build-morale-remotely">work preferences</a>&#8221; – the proclivities, leanings, and habits of how we all like to work.</p>



<p>To encourage positive team morale, you&#8217;ll want to ask your team members what their work preferences are, particularly around social events, before you mandate that they all need to show up for the Friday online game activity. </p>



<p><strong>Start with these work preference questions:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Where on the spectrum of an extrovert to introvert would you place yourself?</li>



<li>How much social interaction do you typically enjoy at work?</li>



<li>What&#8217;s your biggest work-related pet peeves?</li>



<li>What does &#8220;work-life balance&#8221; mean to you?</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">DO NOT:  Say &#8220;ASAP&#8221;, &#8220;Urgent&#8221;, and &#8220;Should&#8221;.</h3>



<p>When we&#8217;re trying to figure out how to build team morale remotely, we tend to use words that we think will accelerate progress. So we find ourselves saying things like, &#8220;ASAP,&#8221; &#8220;urgent&#8221; and &#8220;should&#8221; more frequently.</p>



<p>However, these words only give us the illusion of control. In reality,  they incite pressure –&nbsp;and pressure can have disastrous consequences on the outcome itself. </p>



<p>Edward Deci, the seminal scholar on human motivation, found <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Why-We-What-Understanding-Self-Motivation/dp/0140255265/">in his 20 years of research</a> that exerting a feeling of pressure or control on others unknowingly chips away at people&#8217;s intrinsic motivation. His studies revealed how when pressure is applied, performance worsens, quality of outcomes worsen, the person learns less, and the person ends up not enjoying the task as much. </p>



<p>Rather, there are alternative words we can use.</p>



<p><strong>Instead of saying, &#8220;ASAP&#8221;, try saying&#8230;</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>&#8220;Is this deadline reasonable?&#8221;</li>



<li>&#8220;What trade-off will we need to make so X is delivered by this time?&#8221;</li>



<li>&#8220;What can I take off your place so we can accomplish this?&#8221;</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Instead of saying, &#8220;We should do Y&#8230;&#8221;, try saying&#8230;</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>&#8220;What&#8217;s your opinion on how to move forward?&#8221;</li>



<li>&#8220;What do you think is the best way to approach this?&#8221;</li>



<li>&#8220;What advice would you give me if you were in my position?&#8221;</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Instead of saying, &#8220;These are your goals&#8230;&#8221;, try saying&#8230;</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>&#8220;What goals would you get excited about achieving?&#8221;</li>



<li>&#8220;What should the team accomplish that you&#8217;d be proud of?&#8221;</li>



<li>&#8220;What kind of work would make you feel energized and &#8220;I&#8217;m glad I did that?&#8221;</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">DO: Give choice. </h3>



<p>Of all the practices for how to build team morale remotely, the most powerful is this:  Give choice. </p>



<p>Choice, as found by Deci in his <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Why-We-What-Understanding-Self-Motivation/dp/0140255265">research</a>, enables people to feel more agency and self-efficacy – and as a result, increases the likelihood of positive morale. </p>



<p>We as leaders can give options and create alternative pathways for our team. And it does not need to be grand. Choice on even the smallest of levels&nbsp;can help improve team morale.</p>



<p><strong>For example, here are questions you can ask that  give choice around small items&#8230;</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>&#8220;What time of day would you prefer our 1:1 meetings?&#8221;</li>



<li>&#8220;How often – if at all – would you prefer me to check in with you before a project is due?&#8221;</li>



<li>&#8220;Do you prefer receiving feedback via writing (e.g., Basecamp, email, Slack) or via a video call (e.g., Zoom) or a phone call?&#8221;</li>
</ul>



<p>Certainly, there are times when we cannot offer choice. A situation is out of our hands, and we can&#8217;t influence the degree of optionality offered. Acknowledge this. Doing so will help your team feel as though you are in tune and not oblivious to the frustrating nature of the circumstance. You too feel it. </p>



<p><strong>For instance, you can simply say:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>&#8220;I know this sucks.&#8221;</li>



<li>&#8220;I know I&#8217;m putting you in a tough spot.&#8221;</li>



<li>&#8220;This is a terrible situation, and I&#8217;m sorry for it.&#8221;</li>
</ul>



<p>Admitting a deplorable situation doesn&#8217;t make you deplorable:  It makes you well-adjusted to reality. And that is is in fact helpful for team morale. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">DO NOT:  Strengthen deadlines and the frequency of check-ins. </h3>



<p>It can be tempting to increase the frequency of your check-ins and tighten the deadlines you&#8217;ve set as a means for how to build team morale remotely. Especially in a remote environment where things feel more opaque to you, it can often seem like the only way forward. </p>



<p>However, things don&#8217;t move faster because we&#8217;re touching them more. Rather, we cause interference and add baggage. The more pressure we put on a direct report in the form of check-ins and deadlines will continue to erode team morale.</p>



<p>What should you do instead?  Read on.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">DO:  Clarify expectations and progress being made. </h3>



<p>If we want morale to be high and to speed up the progress being made, we must make clear what is expected from our team and what that progress is. What accelerates work and people feeling good about what they are doing is (1) knowing why they should be doing it and (2) seeing that progress. This is how to build team morale remotely.</p>



<p>Consequently, instead of more deadlines and check-ins, you must define what success is, clarify the expectations to get there, and create a system where people can proactively share progress. </p>



<p><strong>To define success, you can ask questions like:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>How should we define success?</li>



<li>How will we know when we have been successful?</li>



<li>What&#8217;s the best way to define if something is &#8220;done&#8221; or &#8220;high quality&#8221;?</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>To clarify expectations, you can ask questions like:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>What&#8217;s the best way to share progress about this project?</li>



<li>When is it most helpful for you to loop me in?</li>



<li>How much context upfront would you like before I hand off a project or a task?</li>
</ul>



<p>To create a system where your team can proactively share progress, you can use a tool – perhaps email, or Google Docs, or even software that asks everyone to share each day, &#8220;What are you working on?&#8221;  </p>



<p>At Canopy, we have a tool called the <a href="https://canopy.is/m/tools/heartbeats?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=build-morale-remotely">Heartbeat</a> that does this, and then shares the answers with everyone automatically. Be sure to give our <a href="https://canopy.is/m/tools/heartbeats?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=build-morale-remotely">Heartbeats</a> in Canopy a try if you&#8217;re looking to automate your status updates and improve morale.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">DO NOT: Try to &#8220;measure morale&#8221; all the time. </h3>



<p>Remember that morale is sentiment – and it can influence engagement, motivation and culture – but it is not a singular predictor of any one of those elements.</p>



<p>Yet we don&#8217;t always remember this – and this is most clearly shown when we attempt to measure morale. When we try to measure morale, we often fall into the pitfall of overcomplicating it and overstating it&#8217;s influence on engagement, motivation, and culture. For example, some teams will be focused elements completely unrelated to a team&#8217;s true needs for positive morale. Or other times, a team will inflate their scores, giving the guise that morale is positive when in reality it&#8217;s not. </p>



<p>We also overuse team pulse surveys, inundating and overwhelming our team with too many questions too frequently, and failing to take action on the results. </p>



<p>Instead, we should pause and ask:  What is this all for? </p>



<p>The truth is that we do all this measurement because we&#8217;re attempting to <em>understand how our team is feeling so we can do something about it</em>. </p>



<p>If we want to figure out how to build team morale remotely, rather than trying to simply measure it all the time, we should try to create an environment where team members feel comfortable telling us the truth of how they feel. </p>



<p>More on this below. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">DO:  Create an environment where team members feel comfortable telling you how they truly feel. </h3>



<p>You cannot improve morale unless your team is willing to tell you their true state of morale and what is affecting their morale. </p>



<p>In order for them to be honest with you, they must be able to, in a word, <em>trust</em> you. They most believe not only that no ill repercussion will occur if the truth is spoken – but also some genuine listening and follow-through will be sought. </p>



<p>In fact, when we surveyed managers and asked what were <a href="https://canopy.is/blog/2019/02/12/the-3-most-effective-ways-to-build-trust-as-a-leader/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=build-morale-remotely">the most effective ways to build trust</a>, the top three answers were: (1) Show vulnerability (2) Make intentions clear and (3) Follow through on commitments.</p>



<p>In short, your team must feel you truly <em>want</em> to know what their morale is –&nbsp;in both your words, and your actions. They want to <em>hear</em> that you know the team&#8217;s morale could be higher and that you haven&#8217;t always done the best job of encouraging that, and they want to <em>see</em> you take small actions to have that be true. A trusting environment enables your team to tell you their true state of morale, which is what you&#8217;re seeking in the first place. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">DO NOT:  Put everything on yourself. </h3>



<p>When you sense low morale in your team, it can be easy to pile that dissatisfaction on yourself. You think: <em>This is on me, and I&#8217;ve got to fix it.</em></p>



<p>What you might not be aware of is that pressure you put on yourself doesn&#8217;t protect your team – it deflects <em>onto</em> your team. </p>



<p>The more drained you&#8217;re feeling, the more desparate you&#8217;re feeling, the more drained and desperate your team will feel too. We can&#8217;t hide our own attitude, energy, and morale, as a leader – it&#8217;s unknowingly transferred.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">DO: Take care of yourself. </h3>



<p>This means you have to prioritize your own morale if you want your team&#8217;s morale to be strong. You can&#8217;t ignore that if you&#8217;re feeling dejected, it&#8217;s likely your team will feel dejected too. </p>



<p><strong>Here are some recommendations of things you can do to help bolster your own morale:  </strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Step away. It&#8217;s an obvious action, but one we forget benefits us. Distance gives us perspective. And if we carve out time to see things from a different view, our sentiment on them at times may change.</li>



<li>Create a wedge. If you can&#8217;t step away for a week or two, do create what I call a &#8220;wedge&#8221; &#8212; it&#8217;s a small sliver of time and space for yourself only. Perhaps 10 minutes before you start your workday, to regroup, recharge, and recenter.</li>



<li>Allow yourself to admit how hard it is. Sometimes, our admittance of reality keeps us from relieving any pressure. It&#8217;s okay to tell yourself, &#8220;This is harder than usual right now.&#8221; Sometimes that singular admittance is all you need to regain a bit of stronger morale.</li>
</ul>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity"/>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">In sum, here are the principles and practices you can revisit&#8230;</h4>



<ul>
<li>Don&#8217;t ask &#8220;How can I help you?&#8221; Ask more meaningful specific questions.</li>



<li>Don&#8217;t require participation. Figure out work preferences.</li>



<li>Don&#8217;t say &#8220;ASAP.&#8221; Give choice.</li>



<li>Don&#8217;t strengthen deadlines. Clarify expectations and progress.</li>



<li>Don&#8217;t measure morale. Focus on building trust.</li>



<li>Don&#8217;t put everything on yourself. Take care of yourself.</li>
</ul>



<p>I hope that rethinking of our usual impulses around team morale &#8211; and clarifying what morale is to begin with –&nbsp;can help us make progress, not to short-term blips of enthusiasm, but toward longer-lasting positive sentiment. As we all work remotely these days, many of us for the unforeseeable future, that longer view, not short term view, is one to aim for. </p>

<p>&#8220;Lost in translation&#8221; only begins to describe the perils of giving feedback <a href="https://canopy.is/m/training_modules/10-effective-remote-communication?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=give-feedback-remotely">remotely</a>. How do you tell someone that their tone needs to improve, without your own tone offending them and hindering the likelihood that they&#8217;ll <em>want</em> to improve? How do you give corrective feedback to a brand new employee, when the only interaction you&#8217;ve had so far is via Zoom one-on-one meetings?</p>

<p>Giving feedback remotely is tough. It&#8217;s hard <em>enough</em> telling a coworker something they don&#8217;t want to hear without it being through a screen.</p>



<p>Yet, the reality is, with most of us working remotely these days, giving feedback remotely is a critical skill that our teams depend on us for. How else will our team members know what could be better in their performance and the state of progress they&#8217;re making if we as leaders do not tell them?</p>



<p>To do this, I&#8217;m sharing 5 best practices for giving feedback remotely in a way that is constructive, honest, and encourages a real change in behavior…</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-uncover-your-team-s-communication-preferences-and-style">#1:  Uncover your team&#8217;s communication preferences and style.</h3>



<p>Everyone has communication preferences. Some detest the slightest shadow of conflict. Others love a vigorous debate. Some prefer written feedback because it allows them to digest the feedback in a more rigorous way. Others prefer the feedback is delivered face-to-face via video because they want to register the body language of the other person.</p>



<p>The key insight is to never assume that merely because <em>you</em> prefer to give feedback in a certain way, that your direct report necessarily prefers to receive the feedback that way as well. </p>



<p>To account for this, here are four questions you can ask to understand your team&#8217;s preferences around feedback and communication:</p>



<ul>
<li>What&#8217;s your preferred way to receive feedback, in terms of speed? </li>



<li>What&#8217;s your preferred way to receive feedback, in terms of format?</li>



<li>What&#8217;s your orientation toward conflict?</li>



<li>How would you describe your communication style?</li>
</ul>



<p>These questions, and more, are available in our module on &#8220;<a href="https://canopy.is/m/training_modules/10-effective-remote-communication?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=give-feedback-remotely">Effective Remote Communication</a>&#8221; in Canopy. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-make-what-s-obvious-to-you-obvious-to-your-team">#2:  Make what&#8217;s obvious to you obvious to your team.</h3>



<p>With only our words to convey tone or intent in a <a href="https://canopy.is/m/training_modules/10-effective-remote-communication?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=give-feedback-remotely">remote environment</a>, it&#8217;s imperative that we try to be as clear as we can in our feedback. You must make what is obvious to you obvious to your team member.</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t tell you how many times I&#8217;ve worked with a manager who&#8217;ll say to me, &#8220;<em>I thought I made it clear that they needed to improve their performance… But when their performance review time came around, they were surprised to hear they were performing poorly.</em>&#8221; Don&#8217;t let this manager be you.  Your direct report suffers more pain when they are blindsided later down the line than when they are given corrective feedback in the moment at the time of the original underperformance.</p>



<p>Being explicit in your feedback is harder than it sounds.&nbsp;When you&#8217;re in the conversation, staring into your coworker&#8217;s eyes on the screen, you might find yourself smudging your words and lightening the gravity of the feedback you&#8217;re trying to give. But remember: The blurred edges of your feedback will only confuse and mislead your direct report.</p>



<p>To ensure your feedback is clear and explicit, here are some phrases you can try using in your next one-on-one meeting:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>For instance, when I observed ___ , I noticed it affected </em>___.</li>



<li><em>This occurred ___ times on___ dates. </em></li>



<li><em>These are the words and phrases you used in this situation that came across as</em> <em>___</em>.</li>



<li><em>Our expectations for this role are ___</em>.<em> This is not meeting expectations.</em></li>



<li><em>This is falling short in these ways:  ___</em>.</li>
</ul>

</div>
</div>



<p>This may feel nit-picking to you – but I assure you, the level of specificity and clarity in your feedback is the only way to make what is obvious to you obvious to your direct report.</p>



<p>Not sure <em>when</em> is the right time for giving feedback remotely? Read this piece <a href="https://canopy.is/blog/2019/09/24/when-to-give-feedback-to-an-employee/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=give-feedback-remotely">here</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-emphasize-how-this-benefits-your-team-member">#3:  Emphasize how this benefits your team member.</h3>



<p>Your heartbeat picks up. Your stomach drops. There&#8217;s a ringing in your ear, as the other person&#8217;s voice fades. You&#8217;ve likely felt one (or all) of these side effects of receiving negative feedback. No one likes receiving negative feedback. As a felt experience, it <em>feels</em> icky. As much as we might tell ourselves that, &#8220;Oh I know this feedback is good and for my self-improvement&#8221;, rarely, in the moment, does it register as such. </p>



<p>As a result, when you are giving feedback <a href="https://canopy.is/m/training_modules/10-effective-remote-communication?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=give-feedback-remotely">remotely</a>, keep in mind the felt experience for your direct report on the other side. They are sitting in their home, peering at the video cam on their laptop, listening to their boss tell them they&#8217;ve come up short. Amidst their heart racing, stomach churning, and ears ringing, you&#8217;ll need to remind them that this feedback is in their team&#8217;s best interest – and in their best interest.</p>



<p>Remind them that this feedback can <em>serve</em> them if internalized well. Here are a few phrases you can try when you chat with one-on-one:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>&#8220;I&#8217;m sharing this feedback because I want you to have a productive relationship with the rest of your team.&#8221;</em></li>



<li><em>&#8220;I want you to be successful in this role, and so wanted to share honest observations of opportunities I think you could improve.&#8221;</em></li>



<li><em>&#8220;Your growth matters to me, and I wanted to share this because I know how deeply you care about your improvement.&#8221;</em></li>



<li><em>&#8220;I&#8217;m giving you this feedback because I care about your career progression.&#8221;</em></li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-co-create-a-path-forward">#4:  Co-create a path forward.</h3>



<p>When we offer corrective feedback, as a manager, it&#8217;s easy to resort to a version of saying, &#8220;Stop doing A. Start doing B.&#8221; We want to simply declare the new behavior to adopt, and then be on with it. </p>



<p>While this may feel convenient for us as leaders, it&#8217;s demotivating for our direct reports. As the <a href="(https://www.amazon.com/Why-We-What-Understanding-Self-Motivation/dp/0140255265">research</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Why-We-What-Understanding-Self-Motivation/dp/0140255265"> of psychologist Edward Deci</a> corroborates,  when you try to exert control onto others, the person’s performance goes down, the outcome suffers, the person doesn’t learn as much, <em>and</em> the person doesn’t enjoy the task, itself, as much.</p>



<p>In short:  We can&#8217;t impose a solution on our direct reports if we want our feedback to have any chance of truly encouraging a positive behavior change. Instead, we have to co-create a path forward, and incorporate suggestions and input from our direct report on what <em>they</em> themselves would ideally like to do differently. </p>



<p>To do this, consider asking these one-on-one meeting questions to your direct report when giving feedback remotely:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>Can we think together of ways we can approach this situation differently in the future?</em></li>



<li><em>What are alternate paths for this we can brainstorm together?</em></li>



<li><em>Here are some suggestions for how we can move forward… What do you think of these?</em></li>
</ul>



<p>The answers to these questions can help frame what the new behavior change should entail.</p>



<p>Of course, not all corrective feedback will neatly fit into this framework. Some corrective feedback (for example, blatantly unacceptable behavior) will need to be clearly met with, &#8220;<em>Here&#8217;s what to do instead…</em>&#8221; </p>



<p>However, for feedback where you want the person to be engaged in the solution itself, asking for their input on how to move forward can be tremendously helpful.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-follow-up-with-written-confirmation">#5:  Follow up with written confirmation.</h3>



<p>In a <a href="https://canopy.is/m/training_modules/10-effective-remote-communication?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=give-feedback-remotely">remote environment</a>, things get &#8220;lost in translation&#8221; because of the sheer volume of communication. Chats, video meetings, emails, phone calls… To avoid your feedback getting lost in the din, consider documenting it in writing after you deliver it via video or phone. I don&#8217;t mean in an off-hand 2-line chat in Slack, but rather in a paragraph (or two). Write a long-form message that summarizes the conversation and path forward agreed upon.</p>



<p>This helps not only solidify into memory the feedback that was discussed but also serves as another point of clarification:  Is what is written down understood by both parties, or by only you?  </p>



<p>Here&#8217;s an example of what the write-up could look like when giving feedback remotely:</p>



<p><em>Hi _, </em></p>



<p><em>Thank you again for giving me space earlier today to share honest observations for what I think could be better in your performance about X project. I appreciate you taking it all in gracefully and wanting to work together to accomplish X.  </em></p>



<p><em>To ensure we&#8217;re on the same page, here were my takeaways from the conversation:</em></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Y behavior didn&#8217;t meet expectations for X project. For example:  __.</em></li>



<li><em>Going forward, you&#8217;ll make an effort to do Z behavior for X project.</em></li>



<li><em>I&#8217;ll make an effort to support you during our weekly 1:1 meetings for Z behavior.</em></li>
</ul>



<p><em>To reiterate clearly:  I share this because I care about your personal and professional development. I know the progress made on these fronts will only add to the incredible existing skills, gifts, and talents you have to offer. </em></p>



<p><em>If you feel that anything I shared here in writing isn&#8217;t what we discussed or if I missed part of our conversation, please do let me know. I&#8217;m happy to revise these points and ensure we&#8217;re both aligned here. </em></p>



<p><em>I&#8217;m grateful for your partnership in this.</em></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity"/>



<p>To be clear, this is only an example, written in a style that may or may not be suited to you. In whatever write-up you do put together, ensure it resounds with your own voice.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity"/>



<p>We can&#8217;t settle for &#8220;lost in translation&#8221; in a <a href="https://canopy.is/m/training_modules/10-effective-remote-communication?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=give-feedback-remotely">remote environment</a>. It&#8217;s on us, as leaders, to find ways to giving honest feedback remotely in a way that helps encourage real change in behavior from our team. That meaningful change in behavior – an improvement in performance, a reduction of a bad habit – is what we&#8217;re seeking with our feedback, after all.</p>



<p>Start with these five practices here for giving feedback remotely. Even implementing one of them can help your feedback land constructively, even if it&#8217;s at a distance. </p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="453" src="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Untitled_Artwork-9-1024x453.png" alt="Remote onboarding process day 1" class="wp-image-6566"/></figure>



<p>I won&#8217;t bury the lede:  The one thing you&#8217;re likely missing from your remote onboarding process is what I call a &#8220;<a href="http://knowyourteam.com/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=inline_link">work preferences survey.</a>&#8220;</p>



<p>The concept is by no means novel. You want to better understand the working style of a new employee. What do they tend to get annoyed by in a work environment? What communication style do they default to? How might they prefer to receive feedback.</p>



<p>When you&#8217;re co-located, it&#8217;s easier to answer these questions. You can read body language to surmise that a co-worker is annoyed with you. You can sense that the atmosphere is tense during a group meeting.  And then, after registering these cues, you can act on them:  You circle back to console a hurt teammate, or clarify confusion for a group that was causing a stalemate.</p>



<p>But when you&#8217;re remote, the fog thickens. Slack messages are incessantly pinging and Zoom meetings are streaming back-to-back&#8230; but you&#8217;re not sure what&#8217;s landing well. </p>



<p><em>Was that last direct message too harsh? Did they misinterpret the sarcasm of your joke toward the tail-end of the video meeting?</em></p>



<p>In a <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/lessons/161-managing-remote-teams/topics/1301-intro-managing-remote-teams">remote work environment</a>, working preferences are learned through trial-and-error, rather than the usual observation that happens in-person and preempts misunderstandings and work conflicts. As a result, we&#8217;re more likely to accidentally step on someone&#8217;s toes, rub our team the wrong way with our management style, and cause our team members ire than ever before.</p>



<p>Thus, the remote onboarding process is a singular and significant time to learn people&#8217;s work preferences <em>before</em> we start working with them.</p>



<p>For <em>years</em> I&#8217;ve been asked many times by folks to share this full <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2020/09/14/introducing-work-preferences-survey-in-our-icebreakers/">Work Preferences Survey</a>.</p>



<p>Below, I share the 13 most essential questions on work preferences to ask – and what asking them will reveal to you during the remote onboarding process. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-where-on-the-spectrum-of-introvert-to-extrovert-would-you-place-yourself">#1:  Where on the spectrum of introvert to extrovert would you place yourself?</h3>



<p>The extraversion-introversion dimension is often too eagerly applied – or completely misapplied&nbsp;– when we try to understand our fellow colleagues. (For instance, in a Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/not-an-introvert-not-an-extrovert-you-may-be-an-ambivert-1438013534">interview</a>, psychologist Adam Grant estimates that one half to two-thirds of the population are a <em>blend</em> of introversion and extroversion.) However, it can be particularly useful to consider when thinking about the level of social interaction that your team desires:  Will your new hire be hankering for a two-hour Zoom happy hour every week? Or would that be their idea of a worst nightmare? This question helps you gauge how much social interaction, especially in a remote team, that someone might desire – or detest. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-what-s-your-preferred-way-to-receive-feedback-in-terms-of-speed-e-g-right-away-what-s-your-preferred-format-e-g-written-via-slack">#2:  What&#8217;s your preferred way to receive feedback, in terms of speed? (E.g., right away). What&#8217;s your preferred format? (E.g., written via Slack).</h3>



<p>Okay, so this is really two questions rolled into one <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> But they&#8217;re equally important if you&#8217;re trying to hone in on how a team member might best receive tough <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2019/08/29/7-ways-of-giving-feedback-that-encourage-change/">feedback</a> in the future. For example, you might discover some team members would prefer feedback given to them when things in the week have calmed down, which might not have been immediately intuitive to you.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-what-s-your-orientation-toward-conflict">#3:  What&#8217;s your orientation toward conflict?</h3>



<p>Conflict is the stickiest matter in the workplace, and we all have different reactions to it. Some of us relish it, viewing it as a creative exercise for promoting the best ideas. Others find it dehabiliting to collaboration, and will do anything they can to avoid it. Understanding a coworker&#8217;s propensity or aversion to conflict <em>before</em> a conflict occurs during the remote onboarding process will help you better anticipate how they might handle it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-how-would-you-describe-your-communication-style">#4:  How would you describe your communication style?</h3>



<p>Is a team member direct and data-driven in how they communicate? Or more passionate and idea-driven in their communication? How about in how <em>you</em> communicate? Sharing communication styles – both yours and your co-workers&#8217; – can help bridge gaps when ideas or tricky conversations are having a hard time converging.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-what-motivates-you-the-most-in-your-work-life">#5:  What motivates you the most, in your work life?</h3>



<p>As managers, we constantly are searching for the answer to the question, &#8220;<a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2019/09/06/how-to-motivate-employees-dont-do-this-instead/">How do I motivate my team?</a>&#8221;  What we fail to ask is what sources of intrinsic motivation a team member <em>already</em> possesses that they can tap into. In short, as managers we must figure out, &#8220;How can I create an environment that helps my team members tap into their own sense of intrinsic motivation?&#8221; This question tackles it head on.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-6-what-s-your-favorite-way-to-decompress-after-work">#6:  What&#8217;s your favorite way to decompress after work?</h3>



<p>We all need refractory time to &#8220;cool off&#8221; after the workday. Learning how your team members prefer to do so, during the remote onboarding process, can help you support them to take that time to decompress so they don&#8217;t burn out in the long run.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-7-who-s-been-the-best-coworker-or-team-you-ve-worked-with-why">#7:  Who&#8217;s been the best coworker or team you&#8217;ve worked with? Why?</h3>



<p>This question is deceptively insightful. One of the best ways to discern how to work well with your coworkers is to get a sense for the kinds of people they&#8217;ve loved working with. Do they seem to praise past folks they&#8217;ve worked with for their consistency and humility? Then its likely those are behaviors they will try to exhibit –&nbsp;and will seek out – when working with your team.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-8-who-s-the-best-boss-or-mentor-you-ve-ever-had-why">#8:  Who&#8217;s the best boss or mentor you&#8217;ve ever had? Why?</h3>



<p>Mimicry is the most powerful learning tool. As a consequence, possibly the most influential figures on our own work style are the <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2019/02/13/the-anti-mentor-how-a-bad-boss-influences-our-leadership-style/">bosses</a> we&#8217;ve looked up and mentors we&#8217;ve sought out for guidance. These are people we try to emulate. Their preferences influence our own preferences. You&#8217;ll want to understand who these mentors have been for each of your team members –&nbsp;and be forthcoming about your own.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-9-when-have-you-worked-with-someone-and-noticed-it-not-going-well-what-happened-and-what-was-that-person-doing">#9:  When have you worked with someone and noticed it not going well? What happened, and what was that person doing?</h3>



<p>The scars and baggage of negative work experiences are burdens we all bear. And it&#8217;s likely you heard about them during the interviewing process, prior to the remote onboarding process.  Listening to these moments and unpacking the patterns behind them can help you avoid missteps with your team.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-10-what-do-you-tend-to-have-a-longer-learning-curve-around-compared-to-others">#10:  What do you tend to have a longer learning curve around, compared to others?</h3>



<p>A natural question to ask around work preferences is, of course, weaknesses. But it can be easy for someone to sugarcoat their weaknesses (For example, ever have someone tell you &#8220;My biggest weakness is that I work too hard.&#8221; Queue the eye roll&#8230;) Instead, ask about what tends to take longer for this person to pick up, compared to most. During the remote onboarding process, this will help people on your team to feel comfortable admitting what they feel like they&#8217;re slower at and what they might have to learn to get better.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-11-what-do-you-tend-to-pick-up-very-quickly-compared-to-others">#11:  What do you tend to pick up very quickly, compared to others?</h3>



<p>On the flip side, you&#8217;ll want to get a sense of strengths&nbsp;–&nbsp;but areas that feel especially fluid for the person that might not immediately be disclosed when you first hire someone. You want to discern hidden talents and advantages in working with folks when the thing they&#8217;re working on doesn&#8217;t feel like work to them.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-12-what-s-your-biggest-work-related-pet-peeves-i-e-that-thing-that-other-people-do-that-totally-annoys-you-when-you-work-with-them">#12:  What&#8217;s your biggest work-related pet peeves (i.e., that thing that other people do that totally annoys you when you work with them)?</h3>



<p>What drives you crazy at work? You know what I mean&#8230; Someone doesn&#8217;t mute themselves on Zoom. An executive checks in on you <em>too</em> frequently via email. Your organization has way too many meetings. Whatever the pet peeves are, best to air them out in the open so an honest discussion can be had during the remote onboarding process and preventative action can be taken.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-13-what-does-work-life-balance-mean-to-you">#13:  What does &#8220;work-life balance&#8221; mean to you?</h3>



<p>As leaders, we want to be conscious of not wearing our team too thin. But where that line is drawn is different to each person. As a result, you&#8217;ll want to ask about how each team member defines work-life balance for themselves, so you can have a frank dialogue about expectations with the consideration of what each person&#8217;s preferences are.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity"/>



<p>Trouble brews the more often the phrase &#8220;I had no idea&#8221; is uttered in your team.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;I had no idea that bothered you.&#8221; &#8220;I had no idea you preferred it a different format.&#8221; &#8220;I had no idea that wasn&#8217;t a good way to communicate my ideas</em>&#8220;.</p>



<p>Get ahead of the &#8220;I had no ideas&#8221; and ask a Work Preferences Survey during your remote onboarding process. </p>



<p>The fog in your remote work environment will be lifted.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-yes-we-know-employee-recognition-is-important-but-how-to-recognize-remote-employees-in-a-way-that-feels-authentic-here-are-6-recommendations">Yes, we know employee recognition is important. But how to recognize remote employees in a way that feels authentic? Here are 6 recommendations.</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="429" src="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/artificialpositivefeedbackjpg-1024x429.jpg" alt="How to recognize remote employees in a way that doesn't feel artificial" class="wp-image-6524"/></figure>



<p>While we&#8217;re all chatting through screens, typing on our keyboard, and shooting off emojis, you may be wondering how to recognize remote employees in a way that doesn&#8217;t feel as sterile or contrived as the mediums we use to communicate remotely.  </p>



<p>Do you send your team member a gift card when they succeed at a big project? Do you Slack them a &#8220;thank you&#8221; via DM? What truly translates as gratitude when trying to recognize a remote employee?</p>



<p>As a remote manager, you likely know of the benefits of employee recognition. According to a <a href="https://go.globoforce.com/rs/862-JIQ-698/images/Globoforce_SHRM_2015.pdf">2015 SHRM/Globoforce Survey</a> with 6,000 people, 86% of people believe employee recognition increases employee happiness. </p>



<p>Though, I likely didn&#8217;t need to even cite that statistic for you know that receiving positive feedback feels good, for ourselves included <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>The tricky part of how to recognize remote employees well is to do it in a way that does, in fact, increase this happiness –&nbsp;and doesn&#8217;t feel cheesy and transactional. Especially if giving positive employee recognition isn&#8217;t something that comes naturally to you.</p>



<p>To do this, here are 6 important considerations for how to recognize remote employees in a way that doesn&#8217;t feel artificial:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-words-words-words">#1:  Words, words, words. </h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/time-to-rethink-employee-recognition-strategy.html">2018 Deloitte survey</a> with 16,000 people, <strong>54% of employees said that they preferred a verbal thank-you and 31% preferred a written thank-you </strong>when being recognized for day-to-day accomplishments. Compare that to only 14% of employees saying a gift or celebration of some kind was their preferred form of employee recognition. Clearly, employees aren&#8217;t looking for a bunch of fanfare. Direct, genuine words go a long way. And, especially, when you&#8217;re remote, it can mean more than trying to mail a gift to someone. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-it-s-not-just-what-you-say-but-how-you-say-it">#2:  It&#8217;s not just what you say, but how you say it. </h2>



<p>Our recognition falls short, however, when we fail to be specific about who and what we&#8217;re recognizing. It&#8217;s easy to fall prey to this. Ever said, &#8220;Good job, team&#8221; without specifying names of team members or the task itself? While well-intentioned, you missed a prime opportunity to have your employee recognition feel more sincere. Next time, be sure to<strong> get specific about the event, the project, the situation </strong>–&nbsp;and about people&#8217;s names – that you want to highlight. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-spot-the-van-gogh">#3:  Spot the Van Gogh. </h2>



<p>Vincent Van Gogh might be the most celebrated painter of today – yet whose work was egregiously overlooked by his contemporaries.<strong> Don&#8217;t miss the Van Gogh in your <em>own</em> team</strong>. In Know Your Team, one of our Culture Questions we ask is, &#8220;Have you seen someone here do great work that&#8217;s gone unnoticed?&#8221; Out of 1,148 responses across 209 companies who asked this question, 76% of people said, &#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve seen someone do great work here that&#8217;s gone unnoticed.&#8221;  Start looking closer at your own team:  What great work is happening right under your nose that you haven&#8217;t quite noticed yet?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-progress-not-just-accomplishments">#4:  Progress, not just accomplishments. </h2>



<p>The highlight reel is a natural thing to laud. When someone reaches a milestone, closes a deal, ships a new feature, launches a new product – we celebrate and we recognize. But <strong>what about the progress made, even when the final destination hasn&#8217;t been reached yet?  </strong>Recognizing the journey matters too. An essential part of how to recognize remote employees well includes drawing attention to the obstacles someone has surmounted, and how far someone has come.<strong> </strong>Recognition of progress is as meaningful as the recognition of accomplishments.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-their-words-not-yours">#5:  Their words, not yours.  </h2>



<p>One of the most effective ways to recognize your team is to share the words of others – not just yours. For example, <strong>is there a glowing customer review that would be encouraging to the team?</strong> Or how about the complement one of your partners gave you about how easy it was to work with one of your team members? Share the words of others, and not just your own.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-6-lean-into-your-own-recency-bias">#6: Lean into your own recency bias. </h2>



<p>We remember something the more recent it happened to us. As a result, when you notice something exceptional in your team that should be recognized,<strong> it&#8217;s best to recognize it as soon as you can </strong>– versus waiting before you (or the other person!) forgets about it.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity"/>



<p>Yes, these 6 best practices require a bit more energy and time on your end than issuing a gift card to someone on their work anniversary or giving a quick thumbs-up emoji in a Slack channel. But in a way, that&#8217;s what makes this form of employee recognition meaningful. You&#8217;ve taken the time to be specific, write a thoughtful statement or two. That conscientious and care translates, even while working remotely. </p>



<p>Try to carve out even 10 minutes to consider these six tips for how to recognize remote employees next week. You might be surprised by the difference it makes.</p>

We&#8217;ve made it easy to do well (especially while remote).</h2>



<p>According to a <a href="http://interactauthentically.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Interact-Report-V2.pdf">2015 Interact/Harris Poll</a> with 1,000 employees, 63% of employees do not think their managers give positive recognition in the workplace.</p>



<p>Ouch. Might you accidentally be one of those managers?</p>



<p>It&#8217;s all good <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> That&#8217;s why we built <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/shout_outs/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">&#8220;Shout-outs <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4e3.png" alt="📣" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />&#8221;</a>– a brand new feature in <a href="http://knowyourteam.com/m/features/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">Know Your Team</a> to encourage rapport by sharing meaningful positive recognition in your team.</p>



<p>Positive feedback is such an easy thing to forget to do when we&#8217;re in the thick of the day to day of our work. Sure, we might drop a quick &#8220;Thanks&#8221; in Slack occasionally… But it&#8217;s not specific, nor is it shared with anyone else on the team.</p>



<p>As a result, Shout-outs makes it easy and regular for you to give positive recognition in the workplace to your teammates – without it feeling cheesy or stiff.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-here-s-a-quick-screenshot-of-what-it-looks-like-when-your-team-has-given-each-other-shout-outs">Here&#8217;s a quick screenshot of what it looks like when your team has given each other Shout-outs…</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/shout_outs/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="783" src="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Shout_outs-1024x783.png" alt="Shout-outs for positive recognition in the workplace" class="wp-image-6472"/></a></figure>



<p>What I personally love about <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/shout_outs/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">Shout-outs</a> is that it enables all your team members to give shout-outs to each other – so you cultivate a culture of trust by enabling everyone to positively recognize each other, peer to peer. </p>



<p>It also directly integrates with <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/slack">Slack</a>, simply use the <strong>‘/shout-out’&nbsp;</strong>command, and that&#8217;s it <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f604.png" alt="😄" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />  If your team doesn&#8217;t use Slack – all good! They&#8217;ll get soft, occasional nudges via email from time to time to share a shout-out about a peer who&#8217;s work has gone unnoticed.</p>



<p>Not really a &#8220;Shout-outs kind of person&#8221;? I totally get it. For some of us, giving positive recognition in the workplace can feel more unnatural, than for others. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-here-are-some-quick-tips-to-give-a-shout-out-that-feels-meaningful-and-not-contrived">Here are some quick tips to give a shout-out that feels meaningful and not contrived…</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Don&#8217;t force it. </strong>No need to use shout-outs unless there is something you truly do want to recognize a team member for – or else, it&#8217;ll feel artificial.</li><li><strong>Be specific. </strong>Calling out a specific event or instance will make your feedback feel more significant.</li><li>Share a customer review. One of the best ways to positively recognize someone is to share the words of a customer or client about the work they&#8217;ve done. </li><li><strong>Remove buzzwords.</strong> “You’re a rock star who’s killing it.” Yuck. Anytime you use a trite phrase, you erode the sincerity within your comment. Don’t depend on hyperbole to communicate your praise. Take a moment to be genuine. Say what you mean.</li></ul>



<p>You can use <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/shout_outs/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">Shout-outs</a> in KYT to do all of the above – even if giving a shout-out normally isn&#8217;t 100% your style <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f60a.png" alt="😊" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>Hope this is useful, particularly as you&#8217;re working remotely. Excited for you and your team to benefit from <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/shout_outs/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">Shout-outs</a>!</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="454" src="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/new-manager-training-1024x454.png" alt="New Manager Training Path" class="wp-image-6448"/></figure>



<p>&#8220;How exactly do I get new manager training right?&#8221;</p>



<p>I hear this question often because, well, new manager training is a hard thing to nail.</p>



<p>First of all, anytime someone is new at anything, it&#8217;s hard to help them become better.</p>



<p>Second, the definition of what makes a &#8220;good leader&#8221; is unclear to begin with. The list of skills that people could say you need ranges from &#8220;delegation&#8221; to &#8220;team-building&#8221; to &#8220;decision making&#8221; to &#8220;communication&#8221; and the list seems to go on and on&#8230; As leadership scholar Ralph Stogdill famously remarked in 1974, &#8220;There are almost as many definitions of leadership as there are persons who have attempted to define the concept.&#8221;</p>



<p>Despite this, getting new manager training right could not be more <em>needed</em>.</p>



<p>If team performance hinges on anything, it hinges on the manager. According to Gallup, 50% of Americans have <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/231593/why-great-managers-rare.aspx">left</a> a job to get away from their boss at some point in their career. <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/231593/why-great-managers-rare.aspx">Managers</a> account for &#8220;70% of variance in employee engagement scores across business units&#8221;.</p>



<p>On top of that, what makes new manager training so necessary is because we&#8217;re not well equipped to become good managers when we&#8217;re first starting out. Most of us as leaders do not come out of the gate possessing the skills of a good leader. <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/231593/why-great-managers-rare.aspx">Gallup</a> further found how only 1 in 10 people &#8220;possess the talent to manage.&#8221;  Not to mention, that oftentimes our own companies choose the wrong people in the first place to be in manager roles – this apparently <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/231593/why-great-managers-rare.aspx">happens</a> 82% of the time. </p>



<p>As a result, new manager training must address this gap. </p>



<p>Does a &#8220;right&#8221; learning path for a new manager to close this gap exist? </p>



<p>Yes, it does <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> From our research over the past 6+ years, working with 15,000+ people through <a href="http://knowyourteam.com/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=inline_link">Know Your Team</a>, and distilling research from the past 50+ years, we&#8217;ve uncovered the essential components for teaching new managers.</p>



<p>Below, I detail the foundational teachings you should include in your new manager training – and suggestions for how to help your new managers put those concepts into practice. </p>



<p>Let&#8217;s dive in.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-teaching-1-the-mindset-shift">Teaching #1:  The Mindset Shift.</h2>



<p>We often assume leadership requires a change in what we <em>do</em> – when it in fact requires the greatest change in how we <em>think</em>.  Consequently, the first thing you&#8217;ll want to address in your new manager training is the <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2019/01/15/how-to-become-a-good-new-manager/">mindset shift</a> required to be an effective new manager. </p>



<p>Here&#8217;s what the mindset shift is: <strong> When you&#8217;re an individual contributor, your success is defined by the work that <em>you</em> do. When you&#8217;re a manager, your success is defined by how well you enable <em>other</em> people to get the work done. </strong></p>



<p>This means, as a manager, you&#8217;re success is predicated on how well you create an environment for others to do their job – not doing the work itself. Having meaningful one-on-one conversations that unpack feedback from the team, creating communications that share context and expectations clearly – that helps set the environment for your team to do their best work. </p>



<p>But if you find yourself rolling up your sleeves and digging into the work itself, as a manager – fixing bugs, editing copy, making sales calls – you end up causing your team to be overreliant on your efforts. You end up smothering your team. You are not fulfilling your true purpose as a manager. You are not internalizing the mindset shift.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-teach-this-in-your-new-manager-training">How to teach this in your new manager training?</h3>



<p>The best way to teach the mindset shift to help a new manager become aware of it, to begin with. It&#8217;s an incredibly easy thing to be blind to, as a new manager.</p>



<p>Consequently, as a part of your new manager training, make sure to act on the following:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Help your new manager get clear on what success is</strong>. Define success as what the &#8220;team is accomplishing&#8221; – not the individual work + amount of work that the individual manager is accomplishing. <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2019/01/15/how-to-become-a-good-new-manager/">This blog piece details this mindset shift in more detail</a>.</li><li>Check-out the <strong>&#8220;Building Trust in a Team&#8221;</strong> module from <strong>Starting as a New Leader</strong> learning path in <a href="http://knowyourteam.com/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=inline_link">Know Your Team</a> – we have 4 lessons and a series of reflection questions for you to learn the subject and apply to your own context.</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-teaching-2-trust-is-the-oil-of-a-team">Teaching #2:  Trust is the oil of a team.</h2>



<p>You likely don&#8217;t need to read this blog post to know that trust is a critical concept to teach your new managers. However, where we often get tripped up is <em>how</em> we define trust in our new manager training. When we typically think of trust we think of &#8220;feeling good.&#8221; Trust is about asking your team about how their weekend was, sharing each other&#8217;s hobbies, going out for happy hours in-person or over Zoom&#8230; Right?</p>



<p>Sort of. <strong>To build trust <em>effectively</em>, we must go deeper.</strong> Researchers have identified two different types of trust:  &#8220;Affective trust,&#8221; which comes from our sense of rapport or emotional closeness with a person, and &#8220;Cognitive trust,&#8221; which is based on our belief in the other person&#8217;s competence and reliability. To truly build trust as a manager, we need to do both. In short:  Your new managers need to not only foster rapport with their team, and also follow through on what they say they&#8217;re going to do in order to build trust.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-teach-this-in-your-new-manager-training-1">How to teach this in your new manager training?</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Consider creating a &#8220;managers circle&#8221; meeting once a month </strong>(or even once a week) where you ask your managers to share how they have demonstrated cognitive trust. For example: When was a time where they&#8217;ve explained their intention to their team? When was a time where they actively followed through on something they promised to do? A &#8220;managers circle&#8221; of peers creates a sense of shared accountability and a safe space to ask questions and admit when someone&#8217;s fallen short.</li><li><strong>Suggest that your managers read our &#8220;Guide to Building Trust&#8221;</strong> in <a href="http://knowyourteam.com/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=inline_link">Know Your Team</a> – it has 10+ chapters based on research centered around trust. This provides more in-depth, ongoing learning for how new managers can build trust.</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-teaching-3-1-on-1-meetings-are-your-most-high-leverage-tool-as-a-manager">Teaching #3:  1-on-1 meetings are your most high-leverage tool as a manager.</h2>



<p>Of all the actions that could be salient for a new manager to enact, one-on-one meetings might be the most critical. <strong>Research draws a strong correlation between one-on-one meetings and high team performance</strong>:  Based on our 2018 survey of 1,182 managers, 88% of them said that their 1-on-1 meetings positively affect their team’s performance to a moderate or somewhat high degree. Google’s well-known 2009 manager research code-named <a href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/managers-coach-managers-to-coach/steps/hold-effective-1-1-meetings/">“Project Oxygen”</a> revealed how their higher-scoring managers were more likely than lower-scoring managers to have frequent one-on-one meetings with their team members. </p>



<p>The question is, of course, how exactly can you ensure these 1-on-1 meetings are effective? Below I share extensive resources and tools to makes sure you&#8217;re teaching your new managers a sound methodology for how to get the most out of their one-on-one meetings. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-teach-this-in-your-new-manager-training-2">How to teach this in your new manager training?</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Start by having your new managers read these pieces: </strong><ul><li><a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2018/01/11/the-8-best-questions-to-ask-during-a-one-on-one-meeting/">The 8 best questions to ask during a 1-on-1 meeting</a></li><li><a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2018/10/24/how-to-prepare-for-a-one-on-one-meeting-as-a-manager/">How to prepare for a 1-on-1 meeting as a manager</a></li><li><a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2019/10/03/skip-level-meetings-what-they-are-and-exactly-how-to-run-them/">Skip-level meetings</a></li></ul></li><li>For a full understanding of how to hold effective one-on-one meetings, have your managers take our<strong> &#8220;How to Hold Effective 1:1 Meetings&#8221;</strong> module in our training program, and then read our <strong>&#8220;Guide to Effective One-on-One Meetings&#8221;</strong> in <a href="http://knowyourteam.com/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=inline_link">Know Your Team</a> – it&#8217;s been touted as the &#8220;best guide to one-on-one meetings&#8221; by many of our customers.</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-teaching-4-answer-the-questions-what-s-going-on-and-where-are-we-going-for-your-team">Teaching #4: Answer the questions, &#8220;What&#8217;s going on?&#8221; and &#8220;Where are we going?&#8221; for your team.</h2>



<p>Any experienced leader will assert that a team must understand and be sharing what progress is being made in the team, and why that progress is important.</p>



<p>However, for new managers, this troublesome thing to figure out how to do well without bleeding into the territory of <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2019/05/01/am-i-micromanaging-my-team/">micromanaging</a>. New managers often end up &#8220;checking in&#8221; on their direct reports too often, pinging their direct reports in Slack multiple times a day, leaving them feeling stifled and constrained. Other new managers will overcompensate in the other direction: They&#8217;ll tiptoe around their direct reports and take a laissez-faire approach, not knowing how to course-correct or help their team until it&#8217;s too late. </p>



<p>To avoid this,<strong> you&#8217;ll want to teach your new managers  to answer two things for their team:  (1) &#8220;What&#8217;s going on?&#8221; and (2) &#8220;Where are we going?&#8221;</strong>  To answer the first question of &#8220;What&#8217;s going on?&#8221; they&#8217;ll need to find a mechanism that works for them (e.g., staff meeting, daily standup, automatic status update). And for the second question, &#8220;Where are we going?&#8221; new managers will have to communicate a shared vision for the team. Doing both – sharing progress and vision –&nbsp;are essential pieces for a team to operate well. </p>

<p>Don&#8217;t leave your new managers out to dry. Shooting from the hip and learning trial by fire are poor ways to support them. If you want to elevate your new managers, give them a consistent, guided learning path, where they can focus on what they need most first –&nbsp;these 4 teachings – and nothing else. </p>



<p>Getting new manager training &#8220;right&#8221; is <em>not</em> impossible. You can start here.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">You may be asking yourself this as a manager, right now. I am too.</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="590" src="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/what-can-i-do-1024x590.jpg" alt="Black lives matter" class="wp-image-6359"/></figure>



<p>My heart is breaking. Yours might be too.</p>



<p>Last week was a reminder of how unfathomably messed up our world is.&nbsp; In the wake of the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery – and too many others – I’m disgusted, horrified, and saddened.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re like me, you may be trying to process what your role can be to fight racism and racial injustice. As a family member. As a citizen. </p>



<p>And, as a leader of a team in your workplace.</p>



<p>That last role – &#8220;leader&#8221;– is an important one. As managers, we are <em>leaders</em>. Not merely taskmasters of when a deliverable is supposed to get done. Not merely arbiters of what &#8220;good enough&#8221; work quality is. </p>



<p>As leaders, our ultimate definition of success is to create an environment where our team can do their best work. An environment where our team feels safe, valued, and respected. An environment where racism is unequivocally rejected. An environment where inquiry, compassion, and inclusivity are encouraged. </p>



<p>This means we can take meaningful action as a manager <em>within our own workplaces </em>– no matter how small – to combat racism. </p>



<p>After all, systemic change starts with change within our own locus of control.</p>



<p>Here are a few steps, both big and small, that we can take as managers in our workplaces:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">(1)&nbsp; Start by checking-in on your Black and People of Color co-workers, customers, partners, friends.</h2>



<p>Tell them you love them, care about them, and stand with them.&nbsp;At a minimum, words of kindness let them know they are <em>not</em> alone.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">(2) Give grace and time-off to your team members.</h2>



<p>Allow your team members to take time off to help clean up their communities, donate blood to those affected by violence, participate peacefully protests if they choose to, and/or psychologically and emotionally begin to heal from the trauma of recent events.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">(3)&nbsp; Share with your company your grief, your pain, and your commitment to fight racial injustice.&nbsp;</h2>



<p>How have you been personally feeling about recent events? Have the killings of George Floyd and so many others opened your eyes and heart to something you hadn&#8217;t fully recognized? Be willing to be vulnerable about how you struggle to know what to say.  How you may have only recently become aware of your privilege. How deeply you desire to do better.</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t worry about perfecting your message. Focus on being empathetic, specific, and heartfelt. This excellent&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hbr.org/2020/03/the-key-to-inclusive-leadership" target="_blank">article</a>&nbsp;written by Juliet Bourke and Andrea Espedido details how you can invoke inclusive leadership in an authentic way.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">(4) Work with your fellow leaders to decide how you will intentionally build an inclusive culture within your own team.&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Remember that DEI initiative you spearheaded a few years ago but never really went anywhere? Reprioritize and invest in it now. Or, recall how you&#8217;ve always wanted to revamp of promotion hiring practices to make them more inclusive?&nbsp; Work on instituting it this week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are a few resources to consult as you take action:</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">When an employee is underperforming while remote, it&#8217;s tough to know exactly what to say and do. Here&#8217;s a path you can pursue to manage a remote employee who is slipping. </h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="579" src="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/remote-underperformance-2-1-1024x579.png" alt="Manage a remote employee who is struggling" class="wp-image-6337"/></figure>



<p>An experienced manager will tell you that it&#8217;s always easy to manage a <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/lessons/161-managing-remote-teams/topics/1301-intro-managing-remote-teams">remote</a> employee when they&#8217;re performing well. </p>



<p>But what about when they&#8217;re <em>not</em>?  What do you do when a remote employee is <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2019/01/31/how-to-discuss-poor-performance-with-an-employee/">underperforming</a>?</p>



<p>Answering this can feel complicated. Given the uncertainty and fear during these times of COVID-19, some of our team members might be experiencing greater <a href="https://www.ajmc.com/newsroom/how-has-covid19-affected-mental-health-severity-of-stress-among-employees">mental burden</a> and emotional distress than usual. Many employees are caretakers for others right now, and others may be having a difficult time coping with the social isolation and the precarious state of our world.</p>



<p>As leaders, we want to be sensitive and empathetic to the fact that these are indeed challenging times for us all – and yet at the same time, we have standards, expectations, and goals that we&#8217;re accountable to. It can feel hard to know precisely what to do…</p>



<p>But a path forward <em>does</em> exist. This is not an impossible quandary. You do not have to suffer in silent acceptance of a team member&#8217;s poor performance because your team is now remote. Nor do you have to cause undue hurtful stress on your team members by confronting their underperformance.</p>



<p>Rather, to manage a remote employee who is struggling well, you can approach the situation with care, positivity, and thoughtfulness. You can, in fact, help that person change their behavior for the better.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s how…</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">#1: Emphasize your intention, not your own emotion.</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Swap out &#8220;You&#8217;re messing up…&#8221; for &#8220;I want to help…&#8221;</h3>



<p>When someone&#8217;s messing up, it&#8217;s easy to want to express our dismay or exasperation. &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand why this is late <em>again</em>&#8221; or &#8220;This is making my job really hard,&#8221; you&#8217;re tempted to say. But no matter how true those statements might be, starting the conversation that way <em>shuts down</em> the conversation. The other person will feel attacked, perhaps even ashamed, and immediately move into a defensive mode. </p>



<p>The minute someone moves into defensive mode, they aren&#8217;t going to want to change. They&#8217;ve hardened. You won&#8217;t be able to get through to them. Conversation over. </p>



<p>Instead, you&#8217;ll want to focus purely on the <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2017/12/01/the-power-of-assuming-positive-intent/">positive intent</a> of your conversation. The #1 reason a person will become defensive is that they misread your intention. So if you can make your intention for why you&#8217;re sharing critical feedback about the performance, the less likely that person will be defensive to your comments.</p>



<p>For example, you could say: <em>&#8220;There is nothing more I want than for you to be successful at your role. But I&#8217;ve realized that I haven&#8217;t done my part in helping you with that by not being as clear as I can. So I&#8217;d love to share as clearly as possible with you where I&#8217;ve observed expectations not met and areas of poor performance. It will feel critical, but it&#8217;s because I want you to be successful, and so I&#8217;d like to be as honest as possible with you.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Notice that the example here does not mince words about performance being deficient. You should be as clear as possible that someone is not meeting expectations. But do so in the context of explaining <em>why</em> you&#8217;re being critical. Intention outweighs everything if you want the other person to truly change and to manage a remote employee well.</p>

</div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">#2: Hone in on observable behaviors.</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Swap out &#8220;You haven&#8217;t done X…&#8221; for &#8220;I noticed…&#8221;</h3>



<p>When you&#8217;re describing what the other person needs to improve, you may find yourself wanting to say things like &#8220;You didn&#8217;t complete X…&#8221; or &#8220;I&#8217;m frustrated when…&#8221; or &#8220;You seem careless when…&#8221; However, those statements point fingers at the person. They may not sound accusatory to you – but there&#8217;s a more productive way for framing your descriptions that will make the other person more receptive. </p>



<p>Frame the areas of improvement as observations, instead. For instance, rather than saying, &#8220;You didn&#8217;t do Y…&#8221; try saying &#8220;I saw&#8221; or &#8220;I noticed&#8221; or &#8220;The team observed.&#8221;  A useful self-check is to ask yourself:  &#8220;Is it observable behaviors that I am describing?&#8221; You&#8217;ll also want to be as specific as possible. I recommend citing numbers and time frames, when applicable.  For example:  <em>&#8220;For the past Z months, there have been at least YY times when I and others on the team have observed that you haven&#8217;t…&#8221;  </em>Another example: <em>&#8220;I noticed YY number of XX that were not completed on time, that was a part of your role expectations.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>The more you can describe observable behaviors, the more probable it is that the other person will be able to see the situation as you see it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">#3: Ignore your instincts – and ask outward and inward questions.</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Swap out &#8220;I think you&#8217;re stuck because…&#8221; for &#8220;How am I getting in the way of you making progress?&#8221;</h3>



<p>You think you know. Someone is underperforming because they have a hard time doing detailed work. Or someone is underperforming because they&#8217;re missing the in-person <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2020/05/10/virtual-team-building-how-to-build-trust-in-a-remote-team/">social interaction</a> with their team. </p>



<p>Whatever the reason is, be wary of the assumptions you project. You don&#8217;t <em>really</em> know why someone is underperforming unless you ask precise questions that help you reveal this. </p>



<p>Ignore what your instincts might be telling you and carve out space to ask questions that help you understand:  What is exactly causing this person to not perform up to standards?</p>



<p>To get to the bottom of this, you&#8217;ll want to ask questions during a <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/one_on_ones/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">one-on-one meeting</a> along two different axes:  (1) Outward (2) Inward. <strong>Outward questions</strong> try to uncover what external factors on the employee&#8217;s side are hindering them. (&#8220;How is the employee themselves or the circumstance itself holding them back?&#8221;) <strong>Inward questions</strong> try to understanding what internal factors on your side as a manager are blocking the employees. (&#8220;How am I as a manager getting in the way?&#8221;)</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Here are some examples of outward questions you can ask…</strong></h4>



<ul><li>How have you been feeling about your own performance lately? Where do you see opportunities to improve, if any?</li><li>How is the remote work environment currently hurting or helping you in making progress on your work?</li><li>What are you most enjoying about the work you’re doing? What part of the work is inspiring, motivating, and energizing, if any?</li><li>What part of the work do you feel stuck? What have you been trying the “crack the nut” on, but it feels like you’re banging your head?</li><li>What part of the work is “meh”? What tasks have you felt bored or ambivalent about?</li><li>When’s the last time you got to talk to or connect with a customer who benefited from the work you did? Would you like more opportunities to do that, and should make that happen?</li><li>Do you feel you’re playing to your strengths in your role? Where do you feel like there is a steep learning curve for you?</li><li>Would you say you’re feeling optimistic, pessimistic or somewhere in the middle about the company’s future?</li></ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Here are some examples of inward questions you can ask…</strong></h4>



<ul><li>Is it clear what needs to get done? How can I make the goals or expectations clearer?</li><li>Is there any part of the way we&#8217;ve set up the remote work environment that feels burdening, stifling, or that simply isn&#8217;t working for you?</li><li>Is the level of quality that’s required for this work clear? What examples or details can I provide to clarify the level of quality that’s needed?</li><li>Am I being respectful of the amount of time you have to accomplish something? Can I be doing a better job of protecting your time?</li><li>Do you feel you’re being set up to fail in any way? Are my expectations realistic? What am I asking that we should adjust so it’s more reasonable?</li><li>Do you have the tools and resources to do your job well?</li><li> Have I given you enough context about why this work is important, who the work is for, or any other information that is crucial to do your job well?</li><li>What’s irked you or rubbed you the wrong way about my management style? Does my tone come off the wrong way? Do I follow-up too frequently with you, not giving you space to breathe?</li></ul>

<p>None of these questions ask, &#8220;What do you think you’re doing wrong?” They&#8217;re not &#8220;trick&#8221; questions that attempt to get the person to incriminate themselves when you look to manage a remote employee. It&#8217;s about creating a mutual, shared understanding. You&#8217;re trying to build a moat, not walls, with these questions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">#4: Co-create a path forward.</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Swap out:  &#8220;Do you have any questions?&#8221; for &#8220;How can we work together to improve things?&#8221;</h3>



<p>Once you&#8217;ve (1) shared your intention in the conversation, (2) objectively shared what you&#8217;ve noticed needs to improve, and (3) asked questions to better understand the root cause of underperformance, now comes for the last piece: (4) Looking ahead.</p>



<p>You want to co-create a path forward. To do this, you&#8217;ll want to avoid abruptly ending your conversation with &#8220;Do you have any questions?&#8221; Instead, share some words that help clear the slate, and indicate that you want to get better <em>together</em> </p>



<p>For example, you could say something like:  <em>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure this is difficult to hear – and that&#8217;s our fault for not sharing these things earlier. But I&#8217;d love to start fresh, to be honest with one another, and support each other. Again:  I want you to be successful in this role. And I&#8217;d love your help in trying to figure out how to build a path to that.  I&#8217;m keen to understand from you:  (1) Do you believe these are areas you can improve on?  And, (2) How can we work together to improve on these things?  Let&#8217;s work on this together.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>This path forward may result in adjusting the goal itself, so it&#8217;s more reasonable. You may even consider moving the person to a different project. Most frequently though, this will result in you implementing a performance improvement plan (PIP). I&#8217;ve written extensively about <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2019/02/15/should-you-use-an-employee-performance-improvement-plan-pip/">the factors to consider in a PIP here</a>.</p>



<p>Whichever next steps you decide, keep in mind it is a step you&#8217;re taking <em>together</em> – and that you as a manager want to support this person in their attempts to improve. The shared responsibility is an important part to manage a remote employee well.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Deliver via video chat and then follow-up in writing</h2>



<p>In lieu of having this conversation in-person, in a <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/lessons/161-managing-remote-teams/topics/1301-intro-managing-remote-teams">remote work environment</a>, you&#8217;ll want to have this conversation via video chat. This way the other person can see your facial expression and hear your tone of voice when you say things like &#8220;I want you to be successful&#8221;. Then, if you find it prudent, you can share a write-up that confirms: &#8220;Here&#8217;s a summary of what we talked about and what we&#8217;ve agreed on as next steps.&#8221; This way, your path forward is documented, and the expectations are crystal clear. </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>For this video chat, here&#8217;s how you might structure the conversation and the <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/one_on_ones/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">one-on-one meeting agenda</a>:</strong></h4>



<ul><li><strong>Catching up (10 &#8211; 15 min.)</strong><ul><li>How is your energy level these days?</li><li>Cook anything good lately?</li></ul></li><li><strong>Performance (30 min.)</strong><ul><li> My intention of this conversation</li><li> My observations</li><li> Inward + outward questions<ul><li>How have you been feeling about your own performance lately? Where do you see opportunities to improve, if any?</li><li>How is the remote work environment currently hurting or helping you in making progress on your work?</li><li>What part of the work do you feel stuck? What have you been trying the “crack the nut” on, but it feels like you’re banging your head?</li><li>Am I being respectful of the amount of time you have to accomplish something?

How can I make the goals or expectations clearer?</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Looking forward (20 min.)</strong><ul><li>How can we work better together? What tactical steps should we both take?</li></ul></li><li><strong>Takeaways / Next steps (5 &#8211; 10 min.)</strong></li></ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Whatever you do, don&#8217;t sit on it.</h2>



<p>What you do not want to do is tolerate the behavior. Secretly hoping that your direct report &#8220;gets the hint&#8221; or that they magically wake up one day illuminated by the idea that they need to change something…</p>



<p>That never happens. If anything, the employee will become frustrated, and even angry, that you didn&#8217;t say anything, to begin with. The last thing you want is a team member who feels blindsided by their own performance. </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>The true indication of effective management is not merely in how you support your team members who are already doing a great job – but how you address, coach, and manage a remote employee who is slipping. </p>



<p>Do this well, and you&#8217;ll have learned to manage a remote employee well.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="429" src="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/remote-one-on-one-1024x429.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6159"/></figure>



<p>If I told you, of all the things you were transitioning from being in-person to online, that your remote one on one meeting would be <em>most</em> critical&#8230;</p>



<p>Would you believe me? </p>



<p>To be frank, I&#8217;m not sure I would believe myself. When it comes to <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/lessons/161-managing-remote-teams/topics/1301-intro-managing-remote-teams">remote leadership</a> (or leadership in general, for that matter), there are no silver bullets. </p>



<p>Yet, if there&#8217;s one thing a <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/lessons/161-managing-remote-teams/topics/1301-intro-managing-remote-teams">remote manager</a> should spend a disproportionate amount of time investing in, the data points to remote one-on-one meetings.</p>



<p>Based on our 2018 survey of 1,182 managers, 88% of them said that their one-on-one meetings positively affect their team’s performance to a moderate or somewhat high degree. Additionally, Google’s famous 2009 manager research code-named <a href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/managers-coach-managers-to-coach/steps/hold-effective-1-1-meetings/">“Project Oxygen”</a> affirms this, as they found that higher-scoring managers were more likely than lower-scoring managers to have frequent one-on-one meetings with their team members. Employees most <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html">preferred</a> “even-keeled bosses who made time for one-on-one meetings.”</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s the kicker: <strong> The impact of a one on one meeting is magnified in a remote work environment. </strong>The remote one-on-one meeting becomes perhaps the <em>only</em> face-to-face interaction that a direct report has with their manager, albeit via video. This rare exchange makes it all the more meaningful – and so getting it right is crucial.</p>



<p>This means answering the question, &#8220;What&#8217;s the best way to hold a remote one-on-one meeting?&#8221; isn&#8217;t merely an attempt to ease the logistics as we transition to remote work. Rather, answering that question is paramount to truly lead a remote team well. </p>



<p>The good news is that I answer this question for you below <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Based on our data from 2,000+ people, I share precisely to prepare and run an effective remote one-on-one meeting –&nbsp;and the exact agenda template you can use for the meeting, yourself.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-best-practices-for-remote-1-1-meetings">5 best practices for remote 1:1 meetings</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-one-on-one-tip-1-give-more-time-for-personal-connection-and-building-rapport-than-you-normally-would">One-on-one tip #1: Give more time for personal connection and building rapport than you normally would.</h3>



<p><a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/lessons/161-managing-remote-teams/topics/1301-intro-managing-remote-teams">Remote work</a> environments require rapport. In a <a href="https://open.buffer.com/state-remote-work-2018/">2018 State of Remote Work</a> survey conducted by Buffer, they found that loneliness was the biggest downside for 21% of remote employees, and one of the reasons that made them more likely to quit.</p>



<p>Not to mention, during a global pandemic, well, rapport and social connection couldn&#8217;t be <em>more</em> needed.</p>



<p>As a result, in a remote one-on-one meeting, you&#8217;ll want to spend more time than you might typically do to focus on talking about things non-work related to foster a sense of care. In fact, Gallup has <a href="https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/147749/value-conversations-employees.aspx">identified</a> &#8220;caring” as one of the indicators that predict employee and workgroup performance and is strongly linked to company productivity and profitability. </p>



<p>Here are some questions you could ask during the first 15 or so minutes of your one-on-one meeting to cultivate this care, connection, and rapport…</p>



<ul><li>How is your energy level these days?</li><li>Have you been listening to any new music lately?</li><li>Have you watched a show recently that you&#8217;ve been enjoying?</li><li>Cook anything new lately?</li><li>Got a podcast you&#8217;ve been listening to that you&#8217;d recommend?</li><li>What have you been reading lately?</li></ul>



<p>Use our <a href="/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">One-on-Ones Tool</a> in Know Your Team to get more suggested one-on-one questions just like this to further personal connection during your remote one-on-one meeting.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-one-on-one-tip-2-be-mindful-of-your-body-language">One-on-one tip #2:  Be mindful of your body language.</h3>



<p>Your eyes dart across the screen to the Slack notifications on your desktop. In that moment, with the camera in Zoom during your one-on-one meeting, you&#8217;ve communicated volumes to the other person without you even speaking a word: You&#8217;re distracted, and what the other person is saying right now to you isn&#8217;t something you value.</p>



<p>During a remote one-on-one meeting, your facial expressions and nonverbal cues do more of the talking than you might realize. After all, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/24/books/chapters/0924-1st-peas.html">studies</a> have shown how over 65% of communication is done non-verbally. </p>



<p>While in the moment, it feels innocuous to scan your email inbox while your direct report is talking during a one on one meeting, the damage is significant. Inattentive body language indicates an inattentive manager. That&#8217;s a perception none of us as managers hope to invoke. </p>



<p>Instead, do absolutely make sure your video camera is turned on during a one-on-one meeting. But when you do, be mindful of what your body language is communicating. One tactical way to do this is you can do a quick self-check before hopping onto your Zoom remote <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/one_on_ones/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">one-on-one meeting</a>. Ask yourself:</p>



<ul><li>Have you closed out email, Slack, other browser windows etc., so you can look directly into the camera, undistractedly?</li><li>Have you given yourself a few minutes to collect yourself, and breathe, so you can invoke a friendly, calm demeanor?</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-one-on-one-tip-3-move-your-status-update-to-be-outside-of-your-remote-1-on-1-meeting">One-on-one tip #3: Move your status update to be <em>outside</em> of your remote 1-on-1 meeting.</h3>



<p>The most common failure mode of a remote <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/one_on_ones/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">one-on-one meeting</a> using it for getting a <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/heartbeats/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">status update</a>. You can hear how a project doing outside of the one-on-one meeting –&nbsp;you can easily read a status update in an email, or on Slack, etc.  </p>



<p>You&#8217;re wasting time otherwise. A remote 1-on-1 meeting is invaluable, dare I say precious, time to ask questions specifically about how a person is doing, and to figure out how you can help them do their best work – especially in a remote environment. </p>



<p>This means spending a few minutes <em>before</em> your one on one meeting getting up to speed on the person&#8217;s work ahead of time. One of the most effective ways to do this is to automate your status updates. You can use our <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/heartbeats/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">Heartbeat Check-in</a> in Know Your Team for this. Via email or Slack, we ask &#8220;What are you working on?&#8221; and the answers are shared with everyone, so your entire team is on the same page. </p>



<p>You&#8217;ll save time by not rehashing “What’s the latest on X?” in your remote one-on-one meeting.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-one-on-one-tip-4-focus-on-uncovering-potential-issues-in-the-remote-environment">One-on-one tip #4: Focus on uncovering potential issues in the remote environment.</h3>



<p>With status updates out of the way, you can now focus on the true purpose of your remote 1:1 meeting:  Uncovering potential issues your direct report might be facing. In our 2018 survey with 1,182 managers and 838 employees, we found that 46% of managers and 28% of employees both saw the #1 purpose of a one-on-one meeting as “uncovering potential issues.”  </p>



<p>Frustration with the lack of clarity about goals, tension with other team members who are dropping the ball, a feeling of isolation now that everyone is working remotely… These are just some of the potential issues that your direct report might be facing. Now is the time to figure out if your team members might be wrestling with them. </p>



<p>Here are some of the best questions to ask in a remote <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/one_on_ones/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">one-on-one meeting</a> to reveal any potential issues:</p>



<ul><li>Is it clear what needs to get done, and the level of quality that’s required for this work clear?</li><li>Am I being respectful of the amount of time you have to accomplish something? Can I be doing a better job of protecting your time?</li><li>Have I given you enough context about why this work is important, who the work is for, or any other information that is crucial to do your job well?</li><li>What time of day, while working remotely, are you most productive? Is there anything I can do to ensure you get that time to during the day to focus on your work?</li><li>What feels confusing right now? How can I improve the clarity or cadence of my communication?</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-one-on-one-tip-5-do-not-cancel">One-on-one tip #5: Do not cancel <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></h3>



<p>Things happen. I know. But the minute we cancel a one-on-one meeting, particularly if it&#8217;s remote, we signal to our direct report:  &#8220;I have other things to take care of that I believe are more important than talking to you.&#8221; That is a difficult message to overwrite in the future. It&#8217;s better to let your actions do the talking, and uphold your commitments to hold regular one-on-one meetings with your employees when you say you&#8217;re going to. </p>



<p>To give you a sense of exactly how often you might want to be holding your remote one-on-one meetings, from our survey of 1,182 managers and 838 employees, here&#8217;s how often other managers hold one-on-one meetings:</p>



<ul><li>35% of managers say they hold 1:1 meetings weekly</li><li>29% of managers say they hold 1:1 meetings bi-weekly</li><li>23% of managers say they hold 1:1 meetings once a month</li><li>9% of managers say they hold 1:1 meetings bimonthly</li><li>3% of managers say they hold 1:1 meetings every six months</li></ul>



<p>Keep in mind that these survey results were collected in 2018 and included teams that were both remote and co-located. So it&#8217;s not a direct reflection of the frequency of remote one-on-one meetings, specifically. </p>



<p>Rather, it does show, even when in-person, holding one-on-one meetings every week or every two weeks – and sticking with it –&nbsp;is the most favored frequency. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-here-s-an-agenda-template-you-can-use-for-your-next-remote-one-on-one-meeting">Here&#8217;s an agenda template you can use for your next remote one-on-one meeting…</h2>



<p>Based on these four best practices that I shared, here&#8217;s an agenda template you can use during your next remote one-on-one meeting.</p>



<p><strong>Catching up (~15 min.)</strong></p>



<ul><li><em>How is your energy level these days?</em></li><li><em>Cook anything fun lately?</em></li><li><em>Have you been listening to any interesting podcasts? Anything you would recommend?</em></li></ul>



<p><strong>Issues/Concerns (~20 min.)</strong></p>



<ul><li><em>Do you have the tools and resources to do your job well remotely?</em></li><li><em>How does the frequency and channels of communication feel to you?  Do you feel overwhelmed with too much information, or in the dark about certain things?  Is there anything you wish you had more or less communication about?</em></li><li><em>Have you noticed anything about time of day, habits during the week, etc. now in working remotely that enables you to feel you can work best? How can I be ensuring you have the best possible environment for you to be able for you to do your best work?</em></li><li><em>What part of the work do you feel stuck? What have you been trying the “crack the nut” on, but it feels like you’re banging your head?</em></li><li><em>Do you feel you’re being set up to fail in any way? Are my expectations realistic? What am I asking that we should adjust so it’s more reasonable?</em></li></ul>



<p><strong>Feedback (~ 10 min.)</strong></p>



<ul><li><em>What have you noticed that&#8217;s been positively or negatively affecting our dynamic in being able to get work done? Any meeting, process or task we should reconsider or get rid of as a result?</em></li><li><em>What’s irked you or rubbed you the wrong way about my management style? Does my tone come off the wrong way? Do I follow-up too frequently with you, not giving you space to breathe?</em></li></ul>



<p><strong>Team/Company Outlook (~10 min.)</strong></p>



<ul><li><em>Would you say you’re feeling optimistic, pessimistic or somewhere in the middle about the team&#8217;s/company’s future?</em></li><li><em>What can we communicate more often and more transparently, to help reduce the anxiety around the team&#8217;s/company&#8217;s future?</em></li></ul>



<p>Find this agenda template useful?  We give you hundreds of suggested one-on-one meeting questions and agenda templates, just like this, in our <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/one_on_ones/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">One-on-Ones Tool</a> in Know Your Team. </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity"/>



<p>We&#8217;re all grasping for ways to support our team&#8217;s performance better during these uncertain times. To provide guidance and solace. Steadiness and insight. Of all the ways you might consider, I&#8217;d suggest that perhaps the best way is through a remote one-on-one meeting.</p>



<p>Start here, with these four best practices and this agenda template. The little extra time you spend now preparing for your remote one-on-one meeting to include more questions around rapport or being mindful of your body language will pay enormous dividends for you in the long-run as a remote manager.</p>



<p>There is indeed a &#8220;best way&#8221; to run a remote one-on-one meeting. And you can enact it, yourself.</p>

Here are 8 ways to get virtual team building right.</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="454" src="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/virtual-team-building-1024x454.png" alt="Virtual team building" class="wp-image-6144"/></figure>



<p>Virtual team building is top of mind for you. </p>



<p>Now that your team isn&#8217;t working in the same office anymore, the things you used to say to each other in the hall – a simple &#8220;hello&#8221; in the mornings or a smile at someone as you walked by their desk &#8211; are absent. Gone are post-lunch catch-ups over coffee or asking about how a coworker&#8217;s weekend was when you go to fill up your water bottle.</p>



<p>So what do you do?  </p>



<p>You google &#8220;virtual team building&#8221;… And what you find are instructions for how to hold a virtual happy hour and a game where you guess fun facts about team members.</p>



<p>Games and activities are charming, sure. But does it truly help build trust in a remote team?</p>



<p>Yes and no. They can help. But if playing online Scrabble together or sharing cat pictures are the <em>only</em> mechanisms of virtual team building that you&#8217;re relying on, then the bonds of trust in your team will fray fast.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re looking for more meaningful, more sustainable ways of building trust in a remote team, we have to dig deeper.</p>



<p>Ready to dive in? Let&#8217;s peer at the research from the past 25 years and best practices from the past 30 years to fully understand how to build trust in a remote team&nbsp;– and how to get virtual team building right.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-first-what-do-we-mean-by-virtual-team-building">First: What do we mean by &#8220;virtual team building&#8221;?</h2>



<p>One of the biggest misconceptions about virtual team building is that it&#8217;s only about helping our team &#8220;feel good.&#8221;  Warm &#8216;n fuzzy sentiments about each other on the team is unquestionable pleasant – but that doesn&#8217;t mean you should optimize for them in a team.  When a team that is constantly looking to &#8220;feel good,&#8221; they end up flattering each other while avoiding speaking the truth. Conflict is brushed under the rug. Preserving face is valued over honesty and mutual accountability. Your team&#8217;s culture – and performance – will suffer, as a result.</p>



<p>Rather, to get virtual team building right, you&#8217;ll want to focus on fostering trust in a remote team. Trust, after all, has enormous benefits to a team&#8217;s culture and performance that we often don&#8217;t fully recognize. Studies have found how trust is linked to improving <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12184567">job performance</a>, increasing <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236222/build-trust-remote-employees.aspx">employee engagement</a>, and opening up <a href="https://hbr.org/2013/07/connect-then-lead">channels of communication</a>. Trust is the oil in the engine that helps any team (remote or co-located!) get to where it&#8217;s trying to go.</p>



<p>But trust can be a blanket word. Something we casually toss around, without precision. When we aspire to &#8220;build trust,&#8221; we can lose our sense of what that means to begin with.</p>



<p>To do virtual team building right, we must then distill specifically the type&nbsp;– or types – of trust we should be looking to cultivate.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-2-types-of-trust-to-foster-in-a-remote-team">The 2 types of trust to foster in a remote team</h2>



<p>The two types of trust we should foster are what&#8217;s known as &#8220;affective trust&#8221; and &#8220;cognitive trust&#8221; to scholars. <a href="https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/256727">Affective trust</a>,&#8221; constitutes a form of trust based on emotional bond and interpersonal relatedness. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0148296303001401">Cognitive trust</a>, meanwhile, springs from reliability and competence. </p>



<p>Another way to think about it is:  Affective trust is how you feel about the person&#8217;s intentions, while cognitive trust is how well you think that person will act on their intentions.</p>



<p>To manage a remote team well, you need both affective and cognitive trust.  The question is, then, how do you exactly do this through virtual team building?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-build-affective-trust-in-a-remote-team">How to build affective trust in a remote team</h2>



<p>To foster the emotional closeness and rapport that consist of affective trust, you want to make sure your virtual team building efforts include the following:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-prioritize-onboarding-more-than-you-usually-do">#1:  Prioritize onboarding more than you usually do.</h3>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0019850114001849">research</a>, affective trust tends to be more important to foster at the beginning of a relationship. Accordingly, onboarding new hires well becomes even more paramount for virtual team building. </p>



<p>What should this <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2019/06/20/how-to-onboard-new-hire/">onboarding process</a> include? Here are a few key elements for remotely onboarding your team well:  </p>



<ul><li><strong>Context about the team + business</strong> &#8211; Create context write-ups on the company’s history, our purpose + vision + values, how we work (communication, meetings, etc.), business context (market analysis, product vision, etc.), and the key milestones you&#8217;re looking to hit in the upcoming six to eighteen months.</li><li><strong>Direction to what success looks like </strong>&#8211; Have a first clear project. Is it clear what success will look like in first 30, 60, 90 days?</li><li><strong>Encouragement in carrying out the role</strong> &#8211; Share why you hired them. You could even write up a “Here’s why we hired you” letter. Read more in a blog post I wrote on <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2019/06/20/how-to-onboard-new-hire/">how to onboard a new hire remotely here</a>.  </li><li><strong>Sense of rapport so you can work well </strong>&#8211; Hold regular one-on-one meetings. Ask questions about work preferences + expectations –&nbsp;it’ll show you care + build rapport, more than anything else.</li></ul>



<p>During the onboarding process, the initial one-on-one meeting is particularly critical. Here are some of the best one-on-one meeting questions you can ask remotely to <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2020/01/22/youve-got-your-first-one-on-one-meeting-with-an-employee-how-to-prepare/">new hire</a>:</p>



<ul><li><em>What are you most excited about working here?</em></li><li><em>When have you felt frustrated in your first 2 weeks here?</em></li><li><em>What feels unclear? </em></li><li><em>What aspect of your job you would like more help or coaching?</em></li><li><em>If you could be proud of one accomplishment between now and next year, what would it be?</em></li></ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-stop-leaning-on-cliche-icebreakers">#2:  Stop leaning on cliché icebreakers.</h3>



<p>How often do you find yourself asking &#8220;How was your weekend?&#8221; to break the ice before you start a meeting? My guess is more than you&#8217;d like. Your team is feeling the same way too:  Their answers to this question feel worn, tired, and unengaging.</p>



<p>To shift the mood for your team and build affective trust, you&#8217;ll want your virtual team building to focus on non-cheesy icebreakers. Cheeky, enlivening icebreaker questions can reveal something new and intriguing about the person you might not have known before.</p>



<p>For example, here are some Icebreaker questions you could try at the beginning of your next meeting…</p>



<ul><li>What&#8217;s been your &#8220;guilty pleasure&#8221; during quarantine?</li><li>What&#8217;s been your favorite recipe you&#8217;ve cooked lately?</li><li>What are you reading right now?</li><li>If you could pick up a new skill in an instant, what would it be?</li><li>Who’s someone you really admire?</li><li>Got any favorite quotes?</li><li>Seen a TV show or movie you watched recently that surpassed your expectations?</li><li>What was your favorite band 10 years ago?</li><li>What’s your earliest memory?</li></ul>



<p>In fact, in <a href="http://knowyourteam.com/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=inline_link">Know Your Team</a>, we cover the topic of icebreakers and other trust-building techniques extensively in our &#8220;Building Trust in a Team&#8221; module.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-invest-in-a-buddy-system">#3:  Invest in a buddy system.</h3>



<p>An excellent way that remote companies can build affective trust is to build a buddy system as part of their virtual team building. We found that 51% of remote managers and employees do this, according to our 2019 survey of 297 remote managers and employees.</p>



<p>For example, at <a href="http://helpscout.com">Help Scout</a>, a remote company with ~80 people, they give each new employee a “work best friend” (they have a phenomenal <a href="https://www.helpscout.com/blog/employee-onboarding/">write-up on their entire onboarding process here</a>. At <a href="http://automattic.com">Automattic</a>, a remote company with ~1,000 people, they “do a mix of self-guided training and buddy feedback,” as detailed by Valentina Thörner, Happiness Team Lead at Automattic.</p>



<p>In your team, here are two ideas you could try to put a buddy system into practice: </p>



<ul><li>Assign someone an official “mentor” with whom they have one-on-one meetings weekly or bi-weekly to ask questions.</li><li>Randomly pair 2 &#8211; 3 people every week to have a fun video chat over something non-work related.</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-set-up-a-dedicated-chat-channel-for-non-work-related-conversations">#4:  Set up a dedicated chat channel for non-work related conversations.</h3>



<p>My bet is that the lack of casual, non-work related chit-chat is something you&#8217;ve <em>already</em> felt the pain of missing. A place for &#8220;watercooler chat&#8221; is a real requirement to building the affective trust your team needs to thrive. </p>



<p>Here are some examples for what other remote companies do to set up non-work related chat channels as a part of virtual team building:</p>



<ul><li>Writing in a &#8220;watercooler&#8221; Slack channel to say “Good morning” to everyone when you hop online. </li><li>Having a #pets channel in Slack and asking everyone to share their pet pictures. </li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-give-opportunities-for-non-work-related-video-chats">#5:  Give opportunities for non-work related video chats.</h3>



<p>Chat is nice… But there&#8217;s nothing like getting to see folks&#8217; facial expressions and hear them laugh, when it comes to building affective trust. As a result, video chats would be a key part of how you do virtual team building.   </p>



<p>Here are some examples of what other remote companies do:</p>



<ul><li>At <a href="http://litmus.com/">Litmus</a>, a remote company with 100+ employees, week to week, they get “Coworker Coffees” over video, drink beers on Skype, and play video games online. </li><li>At Help Scout, they organize 15–30-minute coffee breaks over video between randomly assigned team members called <a href="https://www.helpscout.com/blog/remote-team-connectivity/">Fikas</a>. </li><li>Other organizations, as discussed in our online leadership community, will hold book club discussions or have specific topics or themes about video chats, such as food, music, etc.</li></ul>



<p>One thing to be wary of if you decide to do this is that folks may be severely burnt out on being on video meetings all day. They may not be eager to engage in yet <em>another</em> video meeting, even if the topic itself is fun. As a result, make sure to make participation in these video hangouts 100% optional – and don&#8217;t guilt folks into attending.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-build-cognitive-trust-in-a-remote-team">How to build cognitive trust in a remote team</h2>



<p>If affective trust is all about the &#8220;heart&#8221; – the emotional closeness and rapport someone feels&nbsp;– then cognitive trust is as all about the &#8220;head.&#8221; Cognitive trust stems from believing in the reliability and capabilities of someone else.</p>



<p>Cognitive trust is quite easy to forget –&nbsp;and yet, it yields tremendous results. For instance, <a href="http://essay.utwente.nl/65415/7/Jacoub_BA_MB.pdf">one study</a> found how cognitive trust tends to have a stronger correlation with leadership effectiveness.</p>



<p>In our own 2018 survey with 597 managers and employees, we found a similar confirmation. We asked survey respondents, &#8220;What do you believe is the most effective way for building trust?&#8221; and gave them nine options. The top three options that received the highest rankings from survey respondents were in fact all forms of cognitive trust. Here they are, below, so you can put them into action:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-be-willing-to-show-vulnerability-as-a-leader">#1:  Be willing to show vulnerability as a leader.</h3>



<p>Twenty-eight percent of people said being vulnerable and admitting your shortcomings as a leader was the most effective way to build trust. For both employees and managers in the survey, they remarked vulnerability around your weaknesses and mistakes demonstrated empathy: The more empathetic someone was, the more likely they were to trust them. One person in the survey, in particular, remarked how their manager “needs to show more empathy,” and that “morally he is probably a good person but there are some times when it’s unclear if he actually has empathy due to challenges expressing it.”</p>



<p><strong>To put this into practice, you can try saying something like this during your next one-on-one meeting: </strong> <em>“I feel like the X project I’m overseeing is not going as well as I’d like… might you have any advice?”</em></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-make-your-intentions-crystal-clear">#2:  Make your intentions crystal clear.</h3>



<p>Twenty-six percent of people expressed that making your intentions behind your actions clear was the most effective way to build trust. This means being open about why you’re saying something, and why decisions are made  — and why some decisions are <em>not</em> made. When you&#8217;re opaque about why you’re changing your mind or choosing to sit on something for a while, and it destroys the trust someone has of you.</p>



<p>An excellent example of this is when you need to give someone tough feedback. If you make your intentions clear, they&#8217;re most likely to trust you and be open to hearing that feedback. </p>



<p><strong>For instance, you could try saying during a one-on-one meeting: </strong> <em>“I want to help you be as successful as possible, and help you get promoted. Could I share some feedback that might be helpful?”</em></p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-walk-the-walk-follow-through-on-your-commitments">#3:  Walk the walk:  Follow through on your commitments.</h3>



<p>Eighteen percent of employees said simply following through on commitments was the most effective way to build trust. This seems to be especially powerful given that we found that 48% of employees believed that the company has been all talk and no action on something lately  —  and 28% of employees said their manager has been all talk and no action. </p>



<p>How clear are you demonstrating that you&#8217;re following through on your commitments?  <strong>During your next one-on-one meeting or all-team meeting, try saying: <em> </em></strong><em>“Based on your feedback, I’m changing X. How does that sound?”</em></p>



<p>For each of these three ways of building cognitive trust, you may want to try using our <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/one_on_ones">One-on-Ones Tool</a> in <a href="http://knowyourteam.com/m/features/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">Know Your Team</a> to help you prepare your agenda to include one (or more) of these ways to cultivate cognitive trust. </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity"/>



<p>This can be a lot to digest all at once. By no means am I recommending you try to implement all of these things, all at the same time. These are chaotic, heavy times, and the last thing your team needs is a shot-gun approach to virtual team building. </p>



<p>Rather, I might recommend focusing on <em>one</em> tactic to build affective trust and <em>one</em> tactic to build cognitive trust, first. Then, perhaps you can try another one or two. </p>



<p>Whichever you choose, I hope you&#8217;re as energized as I am to get virtual team building right. Beneath the surface of wanting our team to &#8220;feel good&#8221; is a deeper desire for our teams to trust our intentions,&nbsp;and trust that we&#8217;ll act on them.  </p>



<p>If we can focus on building affective and cognitive trust – and not merely the vanity of how many people are showing up to a Zoom happy hour – our deepest desire for <em>true</em> team building can become a reality.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="429" src="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Untitled_Artwork-8-1024x429.png" alt="questions to ask remote employees" class="wp-image-6105"/></figure>



<p></p>



<p>During these uncertain times, many of us as leaders might feel beholden have <em>answers</em> – not questions –&nbsp;for our team. Questions to ask <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/lessons/161-managing-remote-teams/topics/1301-intro-managing-remote-teams">remote employees</a> are likely not top-of-mind.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re expected to have answers to things like, &#8220;<em>When will we be able to go back into the office?</em>&#8221; or &#8220;<em>Will certain team members will have their jobs still in a few weeks?</em>&#8221; or &#8220;<em>What&#8217;s the outlook of the business six months from now?</em>&#8220;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s natural and understandable. Answers, not questions, seem to be our focus right now as leaders.</p>



<p>Yet in order to do our job well as leaders, <em>questions</em> are what can offer insight, understanding, and resolution – more than we might imagine.</p>



<p>The right <em>questions</em> to ask remote employees can help you, as a manager, understand how your employees are coping with these tough times of COVID-19 – and what they might need most from you as a manager. Even the act of asking a question in the first place can demonstrate that you care, as a leader. </p>



<p>Sure, the UberEats lunch you bought for everyone was a nice perk… But when&#8217;s the last time you asked someone what time of day they are most productive while <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/lessons/161-managing-remote-teams/topics/1301-intro-managing-remote-teams">working remotely</a>? A single meaningful question can make all the difference for employee <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/09/8-things-leaders-do-that-make-employees-quit">morale</a>.</p>



<p>I won&#8217;t just give you one question, though. Below are the 4 most critical questions to ask remote employees – plus 10 other recommended follow-up questions to ask. To understand truly how your team is doing right now during these trying times and best <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2020/04/16/how-to-best-support-remote-employees/">support</a> them, start with these questions here…</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-how-would-you-describe-your-level-of-energy-these-days">#1:  How would you describe your level of energy these days?</h3>



<p>You&#8217;re taking the temperature with this question – it&#8217;ll give you a good overall read of how a remote employee is doing. Additionally, because you&#8217;re asking about &#8220;level of energy,&#8221; it gives the other person permission to share that they may feel worn thin and drained more than usual. You want the truthful answer of how they&#8217;re actually doing, so you can then accordingly support them as a manager.</p>



<p><strong>Follow-up questions</strong> you can ask to better assess their current situation and support them include:</p>



<ul><li>Have you been able to take time for yourself, in any way? How can I support you in that?</li><li>Are there any tasks or projects lately that feel more like a struggle than usual? How can I adjust things to help make that project more manageable right now?</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-what-fears-or-trepidation-do-you-have-around-the-team-and-or-company-if-any">#2:  What fears or trepidation do you have around the team and/or company, if any?</h3>



<p>You might be nervous to ask this question… which is a probable sign you should ask it <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />  The only way you can allay fears in the team is if you know what they are in the first place. Giving your team space to admit what they&#8217;re worried about also reduces some of its ominous nature:  What is known and shared can soften the edges of anxiety.</p>



<p><strong>Follow-up questions</strong> you can ask to figure out the best next steps to address their fears include:</p>



<ul><li>What can we communicate more often and more transparently, to help reduce the anxiety around X?</li><li>Is our plan for the next 45 &#8211; 60 days clear?</li></ul>

<p>You no doubt care about performance. However, we can unintentionally hinder our team&#8217;s performance, unbeknownst to us. This question uncovers how we may be accidentally getting in the way. </p>



<p><strong>Follow-up questions</strong> you can ask to remove roadblocks for your team include:</p>



<ul><li>Is it clear what needs to get done, and the level of quality that’s required for this work clear? </li><li>Am I being respectful of the amount of time you have to accomplish something? Can I be doing a better job of protecting your time?</li><li>Have I given you enough context about why this work is important, who the work is for, or any other information that is crucial to do your job well?</li></ul>

<p>Of all the questions to ask <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/lessons/161-managing-remote-teams/topics/1301-intro-managing-remote-teams">remote employees</a>, this might be the most paramount. The answers will directly inform how you as a leader can be doing differently&nbsp;– or doing more of. Be sure to ask at least a few follow-up questions to know how you can translate your team&#8217;s answers into action.</p>



<p><strong>Follow-up questions</strong> you can ask to better understand where your team member is coming from:</p>



<ul><li>What time of day, while working remotely, are you most productive?  Is there anything I can do to ensure you get that time to during the day to focus on your work?</li><li>What feels confusing right now? How can I improve the clarity or cadence of my communication?</li><li>What can I adjust in my own management style? Does my tone come off the wrong way? Do I follow-up too frequently with you, not giving you space to breathe?</li></ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">You want to help as a manager – but how?  Here are 8 ways to help ease stress, improve morale, and make working remotely easier for your team.</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="429" src="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/support-1024x429.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6074"/></figure>



<p>You want to support remote employees in your now all-remote team. But how, exactly?</p>



<p>These past few weeks, I&#8217;ve gotten countless of questions around how to support remote employees. And so, I thought I&#8217;d write up my recommendations here, based on studying remote teams and working with remote teams for the past 6+ years (not to mention, being a remote team, <a href="http://knowyourteam.com/m/story/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">ourselves</a>!)</p>



<p>This may feel salient to you if you&#8217;ve found yourself more <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2020/04/04/feeling-a-lack-of-motivation-at-work-as-a-manager-lately/">depleted</a> and anxious as of late as a leader –&nbsp;and you&#8217;ve noticed your team is, too. As a result, you&#8217;ve been trying to check-in more with your team during these challenging times and ask, &#8220;How are you doing?&#8221; </p>



<p>But you wonder if there&#8217;s anything else – or something <em>more</em> –&nbsp;you should be doing.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve got some answers for you <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />  To support remote employees during these times, here are 8 things as a manager you can try…</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#1:  Ask more than just, &#8220;How are you doing?&#8221;</h3>



<p>You&#8217;re worried. When your team members hop onto a Zoom call, they seem more worn thin than ever before. As a result, you ask them,  &#8220;How are you doing?&#8221;  It&#8217;s a reasonable question – but frankly, you&#8217;re not going to get a great response. </p>



<p>&#8220;How are you doing?&#8221; is a pedantic, routine question, and so our answers are often pedantic and routine in reaction to it. For example, the most common answer you&#8217;ll likely hear folks tell you is &#8220;I&#8217;m pretty fine&#8221; or &#8220;Oh I&#8217;m doing okay&#8221;… and that&#8217;s it. </p>



<p>Instead of only asking &#8220;How are you doing?&#8221; you&#8217;ll want to ask questions that dig deeper and give more space for your team to answer you fully and honestly about how they are doing in reality. Here are some questions you can try asking during a one-on-one meeting…</p>



<ul><li>Given all the craziness and sadness in the world, how are you holding up? </li><li>What’s your current situation? How are you feeling about it?</li><li>What are you currently doing to sustain yourself? Have you been able to take time for yourself, in any way? How can I support you in that? Is there anything we can be doing to support each other?</li><li>How is your level of energy these days?  Do you feel drained or worn thin in more ways than usual?</li><li>What fears or trepidation do you have around the team and/or company, if any?</li><li>Are there any tasks or projects lately that feel more like a struggle than usual? Where is the weight coming from?</li></ul>



<p>The next time you hop on a Zoom call, if you ask even just one of these questions, it&#8217;s likely you&#8217;ll get a response beyond &#8220;Oh I&#8217;m doing okay…&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#2:  Give an abundance of trust.</h3>



<p>If you recently transitioned to remote work for the first time, a bit of fear might kick in:  If you can&#8217;t see folks at the office, how are you supposed to know that they&#8217;re working?</p>



<p>This is a natural reaction, but as I wrote about in-depth <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2020/04/09/dont-let-remote-leadership-bring-out-the-worst-in-you/">here</a>, it&#8217;s a reaction with disastrous unintended consequences. As <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Why-We-What-Understanding-Self-Motivation/dp/0140255265">documented</a> by psychologist Edward Deci who spent 20+ years studying human motivation, the more we strive to control and impose surveillance on people, the more we tend to kill people&#8217;s intrinsic motivation. Performance worsens and quality suffers all because we try too hard to &#8220;keep tabs.&#8221;</p>



<p>To avoid unintentionally hurting your team, take off some of that pressure and choose to trust your team. Trust –&nbsp;not tracking – engenders productivity. </p>



<p>Now, in a remote team, that productivity is going to feel different. You&#8217;re not going to see folks coming into the office. You&#8217;re not going to see people having brainstorming meetings around whiteboards. You&#8217;ll have to internalize that in now running a remote team, one of the best ways to support your remote employees is to trust them to do the job you hired them to do in the first place.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#3:  Figure out how you might be getting in the way.</h3>



<p>Our primary <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2019/01/15/how-to-become-a-good-new-manager/">goal as a manager</a> isn&#8217;t to do the work itself for our team –&nbsp;but rather, to create an environment to do their best work. And sometimes, more often than not, creating that environment means getting out of our employees&#8217; way. </p>



<p>For example, we may be holding our employees back because we&#8217;re not clarifying expectations with them. Or, we may be hindering them because we&#8217;re not giving enough context.</p>



<p>To figure out how we, as managers, might be getting in the way and to support remote employees, instead, try asking these questions:</p>



<ul><li>Is it clear what needs to get done? How can I make the goals or expectations clearer?</li><li>Is the level of quality that’s required for this work clear? What examples or details can I provide to clarify the level of quality that’s needed?</li><li>Am I being respectful of the amount of time you have to accomplish something? Can I be doing a better job of protecting your time?</li><li>Do you feel you’re being set up to fail in any way? Are my expectations realistic? What am I asking that we should adjust so it’s more reasonable?</li><li>Do you have the tools and resources to do your job well?</li><li>Have I given you enough context about why this work is important, who the work is for, or any other information that is crucial to do your job well?</li><li>What’s irked you or rubbed you the wrong way about my management style? Does my tone come off the wrong way? Do I follow-up too frequently with you, not giving you space to breathe?</li></ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#4:   Make it safe to speak up.</h3>



<p>If your team is scared, they can&#8217;t do good work. That&#8217;s fairly intuitive. </p>



<p>Yet, how comfortable right now might you say your team is about speaking up, suggesting new ideas, and pointing out mistakes –&nbsp;or even admitting their own?</p>



<p>If your answer is, &#8220;Hmm probably not that comfortable&#8221; – that&#8217;s likely an accurate response. Particularly given that these are stressful times, under which people tend to react with more apprehension and withdraw.</p>



<p>Because of this, <em>now</em> more than ever is when you&#8217;ll want to create an environment of psychological safety to support remote employees.</p>



<p>What do I mean by &#8220;psychological safety&#8221;? You likely may have heard of this term before. First <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2666999?seq=1">coined</a> by organizational behavioral scientist Amy Edmundson, psychological safety is defined as &#8220;a shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking.&#8221; It&#8217;s a team environment where people feel comfortable sharing feedback, ideas, opinions, and yes, even admitting and pointing out mistakes. A 2009 study conducted at Google, in fact, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html">revealed</a>: &#8220;Psychological safety, more than anything else, was critical to making a team work.&#8221;</p>



<p>You might agree that yes, that makes sense. So then that begs the question, er, <em>how</em> precisely?</p>



<p>One of the best ways to encourage psychological safety is to personally model the behavior you&#8217;d like your team to exhibit. For example, if you want your team to be forthcoming with mistakes, you&#8217;ll want to choose to be forthcoming with your own. Stepping out to the team and being <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2017/10/30/go-first-the-first-step-of-getting-feedback-at-work-starts-with-you/">vulnerable</a>, yourself, shows firsthand that it&#8217;s safe to critique, offer ideas, and admit shortcomings. </p>



<p>Additionally, you&#8217;ll also want to proactively gather feedback in some way in your team. Our <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/culture_questions/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">Culture Questions</a> in Know Your Team are one of the best ways to do this. (We give you <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2019/05/18/the-32-best-employee-engagement-questions/">300+ questions</a> to help you gain honest insights into your team.)</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#5:  Automate the way to share progress to save your team time.</h3>



<p>Who doesn&#8217;t love saving time?  One of the most cherished ways to support remote employees is to give them time in their workday back. And there is no greater culprit of time consumption than the <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2020/03/05/its-time-to-kill-the-daily-stand-up-meeting/">status update meeting</a>. Oftentimes, especially in remote teams, these video meetings can bleed from 45 minutes to an hour to an hour and a half and beyond…</p>



<p>The good news is that it doesn&#8217;t have to be this way. You can simply ask folks to share a quick written update (think 30 seconds or less to write), asynchronously, each day or each week. This way, across multiple time zones, everyone can be in the loop about what&#8217;s going on –&nbsp;and an hour or more of everyone&#8217;s time doesn&#8217;t have to be wasted on Zoom. </p>



<p>Our <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/heartbeats/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">Heartbeat Check-in</a> in Know Your Team is excellent for this. Every day, you can answer via email or Slack, &#8220;What are you working on today?&#8221; and the answers are all shared with everyone the next day.</p>



<p>The minute you let your team know you&#8217;re canceling all status update meetings in the future, trust me:  They&#8217;ll be beaming. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#6:  Err on the side of empathy.</h3>



<p>As leaders, it can be easy to be caught up in, well, trying to be a &#8220;leader.&#8221; I mean the polished, composed, never-show-emotion kind of leader. But in a remote environment, when so much of the day-to-day communication is written and body language cues absent, showing empathy as a leader is needed more than ever. </p>



<p>For example, if you have a tendency to imbue sarcasm in your writing, you&#8217;ll want to make sure follow-up to them and say, “Just to be clear, I meant X…” or “Did that land okay?”  Or, you can write someone a kind note in Slack thanking them for their effort in their work, or acknowledge that &#8220;Yes, this project is tough and I so appreciate you dealing with it, given the current circumstances.&#8221;</p>



<p>You can also extend empathy for the circumstances we are <em>all</em> in right now working remotely due to COVID-19. Let your team know that it’s okay if a kid runs into the frame or a cat appears in the background of a Zoom call. Adjust and modulate goals, based on the current environment as needed. Give more flexibility during the day to take care of the kids and to take time off.</p>



<p>Our remote employees need our empathy more than ever.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#7:  Give opportunities for team members to support each other.</h3>



<p>To best support your remote employees, don&#8217;t just rely on yourself to do all the supporting. You&#8217;ll want to give opportunities for your team to support each other. Bonding and rallying together while everyone is socially distant is an important part of helping folks cope with the transition to remote work and the realities of the pandemic. </p>



<p>For example, some teams will hold Zoom coffee chats, or play board games with one another. Others will have a dedicated non-work channel.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">#8:  Take care of <em>you</em>.</h3>



<p>You can&#8217;t support your team if you don&#8217;t have any gas I the tank to begin with. I don&#8217;t mean to coddle, but we neglect taking care of ourselves so often as leaders. </p>



<p>Make sure you&#8217;re finding time to sleep, discover calm moments in your day, get some physical movement in… and just breathe. </p>



<p>Your team needs <em>you</em> –&nbsp;and that means you need to take care of yourself.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>As you read through this list, don&#8217;t feel you need to implement all these ideas at once. There&#8217;s a lot going on right now, and the burden you put on yourself to try to do <em>everything</em> at the same time is merely added weight. </p>



<p>Instead, look to try one or two of these suggestions to support remote employees. Then, try another. </p>



<p>From there, you can slowly support your team in a deeper, more meaningful way than you&#8217;ve ever had – without burning yourself out in the process. </p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="504" src="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/remoteleadership-1024x504.png" alt="remote leadership" class="wp-image-6013"/></figure>



<p>I&#8217;m deeply troubled:  Remote leadership can bring out the worst in us as leaders if we&#8217;re not mindful. </p>



<p>Let me explain.</p>



<p>Amidst COVID-19 with more teams are becoming <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/lessons/161-managing-remote-teams/topics/1301-intro-managing-remote-teams">remote</a> than ever before, leaders who are working from home for the first time are trying to navigate the transition.</p>



<p>One reaction to moving to remote leadership?  The title of this article in Bloomberg says it all:  &#8220;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-03-27/bosses-panic-buy-spy-software-to-keep-tabs-on-remote-workers">Bosses panic-buy spy software to keep</a><a href="http://(https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-03-27/bosses-panic-buy-spy-software-to-keep-tabs-on-remote-workers"> tabs on remote workers</a>.&#8221; </p>



<p>Reading the article was like entering a time warp where 18th-century factory management practices had been resurrected. Sixteen-hour workdays enforced by technology under the guise of &#8220;productivity.&#8221; Or perhaps it was a jump forward: A manifestation of an Orwellian dystopia where constant surveillance had become the norm. Managers asking staff to &#8220;stay logged into a video call all day while they work.&#8221; Leaders installing software that takes screenshots on employees&#8217; computers &#8220;every 10 minutes or so.&#8221;</p>



<p>All are the makings of a bad dream that I want to wake up from. Perhaps you do too. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-are-you-contributing-to-the-bad-dream">Are you contributing to the bad dream?</h2>



<p>As you&#8217;re reading this right now, <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/managing_remote_teams_workshop">working from home</a> as a manager, it&#8217;s likely this thought has crossed your mind at some point: </p>



<p>&#8220;I wonder if the rest of my team is <em>actually</em> working?&#8221;</p>



<p>After all, you&#8217;re used to &#8220;seeing&#8221; people be productive in the office. Meetings are happening. Energy is flowing. </p>



<p>And now? It&#8217;s Slack messages, Zoom video meetings… and that&#8217;s it. (And of course, your dog yapping or kids piping up in the background.)</p>



<p>You&#8217;re worried if it&#8217;s &#8220;enough.&#8221; You concerned about the work getting done. You want your team&#8217;s objectives to be met. </p>



<p>So what do you do?</p>



<p>You apply pressure. You drop a &#8220;What&#8217;s the status on XX?&#8221; in Slack as often as your anxious brain thinks the thought. You expect people to respond within 10 minutes and to be accessible by email at night. You hold more meetings to &#8220;just make sure folks are on task.&#8221;  Perhaps you even purchase employee tracking software…</p>



<p>The irony is that this pressure massively backfires when it comes to remote work (and work, in general). The psychologist Edward Deci, who spent 20+ years <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Why-We-What-Understanding-Self-Motivation/dp/0140255265">researching</a> human motivation, observed that several side effects when you try to exert control onto others:  (1) The person&#8217;s performance goes down (2) the outcome suffers (3) the person doesn&#8217;t learn as much and (4) the person doesn&#8217;t enjoy the task, itself, as much.</p>



<p>And so, as you hover over your team and apply pressure on them – yes, you may achieve your goals in the short-term.  But in the long-run? You disintegrate the whole purpose of having a team in the first place:  To enable the capacity to accomplish things you wouldn&#8217;t be able to accomplish on your own. </p>



<p>You are left with shadows of people going through the motions of doing the work, not because they care about the work itself or the purpose behind the work – but because you&#8217;re breathing down their necks. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-get-remote-leadership-right">How to get remote leadership right</h2>



<p>If we don&#8217;t want remote leadership to bring out the worst in us, what can we do? Here are five recommendations…</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-notice-when-you-re-reacting-to-feeling-a-lack-of-control">Notice when you&#8217;re reacting to feeling a lack of control.</h3>



<p>Recognize that the pressure you apply is a reaction to a construct of control. You think you can control people – and things –&nbsp;and the reality is you can&#8217;t. The quicker you can realize this, the sooner you can shift to a frame of mind where you can focus constructively on the things that actually help your team, such as:  (1) Making it clear why the work matters (2) Creating milestones to help that person achieve that work (3) Giving as much context as possible so they can make the best decisions (4) Helping them think through tough problems they encounter. </p>



<p>I dive deep on how to coach your employees in this way in our <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/workshops">Workshop Live! session recording, &#8220;How to Coach an Employee</a>.&#8221; (You can access it when you upgrade to the full version of <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/">Know Your Team</a>.) </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-remember-time-applied-does-not-equate-to-progress-made">Remember:  Time applied does not equate to progress made.</h3>



<p>As a <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/lessons/161-managing-remote-teams/topics/1301-intro-managing-remote-teams">remote manager</a>, you have to kill that paranoid voice inside that asks, “Is my team working?” You can never answer that wholly, even when you are in-person. So why burden your mind with it in a remote environment? </p>



<p>Rather, instead of enveloping yourself in uneasiness, remind yourself that you want to concentrate on the results. And, the path to results is creating the best environment for a person to achieve those results. <br> Effective <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/managing_remote_teams_workshop">remote leadership</a> – or leadership, period, for that matter – is trusting that the team you picked, and you hired, and you chose, can follow-through on the job. </p>



<p>Otherwise, you create an environment where &#8220;looking busy&#8221; is more important than doing the work in reality. For example, I&#8217;ve known employees to spend more time preparing for meetings to show their boss that their working, than spending the time on the work itself. Are you guilty of this?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-make-expectations-absurdly-obvious">Make expectations absurdly obvious. </h3>



<p>Oftentimes, we resort to tracking and imposing pressure on our team when we haven&#8217;t established clear expectations on how everyone is supposed to communicate and collaborate remotely. </p>



<p>This is <em>your</em> job as a remote leader. You need to make clear what the proper channels of communication and modes of work are. Specifically, here are some key questions you&#8217;ll want to answer for your team:</p>



<ul><li><em>What time zones is everyone working in? How will this be communicated? </em></li><li><em> What are the expected working hours each person has? What should the overlapping working hours for folks in different time zones be? </em></li><li><em> If you need to be offline to run an errand or are in a meeting, how will that be communicated? </em></li><li><em> How will it be communicated when someone is sick or feeling unwell? </em></li><li><em> Are there any times team members should not be disturbed? </em></li><li><em> What’s the expected response time to messages? Does that vary depending on what the message is, or the channel that it is delivered in? </em></li></ul>



<p>When you answer these questions for your team, these expectations should be made absurdly obvious. Here are some examples of remote teams (us included!) on how they document these expectations so they are indeed absurdly obvious:</p>



<ul><li>Know Your Team’s <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2019/08/22/how-to-collaborate-effectively-in-a-remote-team/">How We Work</a></li><li>Basecamp’s <a href="https://basecamp.com/handbook/10-how-we-work">How We Work</a></li><li>Buffer’s <a href="https://open.buffer.com/slack-agreements/">10 Slack Agreements</a></li><li>GitLab&#8217;s <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/">Remote Communication Handbook</a></li><li>Automattic’s <a href="https://automattic.com/expectations/">Communication Expectations</a></li></ul>



<p>The more you can illuminate &#8220;this is what effective work in our team will look like,&#8221; the more probable it is that vision will become reality. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-enable-your-team-to-proactively-share-progress">Enable your team to proactively share progress. </h3>



<p>Every time you ping an employee, &#8220;What&#8217;s the status on XX?&#8221;, you throw them off their work. They halt their progress, feel anxious, and scramble to indeed prove to you that, &#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m working and everything is on track.&#8221;</p>



<p>Rather than disrupt folks in this way, give your team an adequate opportunity to <em>proactively</em> share progress with you. When you do this, you enable the person to share with you on their own schedule, out of their own volition, what they&#8217;re working on.</p>



<p>We use our <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/heartbeats/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">Heartbeat Check-in</a> at <a href="http://knowyourteam.com/m/features/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">Know Your Team </a>for this. Every morning, via Slack or email, a check-in is sent out that asks, &#8220;<em>What did you work on yesterday, and what are you working on today?</em>&#8221; Team members (including you!) can fill the <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/heartbeats/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">Heartbeat</a> out that day when it best suits them. After they respond, the answers are shared with everyone. No one is interrupted. And <em>everyone</em> – not just you as the leader –&nbsp;get to benefit from seeing the answers. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/heartbeats/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="470" src="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/heartbeats-1024x470.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6008"/></a></figure>



<p></p>



<p>No longer are you interrogating employees to &#8220;make sure&#8221; they are being productive. When you give the team an opportunity to <em>proactively</em> progress, that progress can now happen.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hold-regular-weekly-or-biweekly-one-on-one-meetings">Hold regular weekly or biweekly one-on-one meetings.</h3>



<p>One-on-one meetings are potentially your most critical tool for you in remote leadership. But only if you hold them in the right way. </p>



<p>In 2018 survey we conducted of 1,182 managers and 838 employees, we found 40% of employees think their manager is “not prepared” or “not prepared at all” for their one-on-one meetings. </p>



<p>To do remote leadership well, it&#8217;s time to change that. To prepare for your one-on-one meetings, first make sure your one-on-one meetings are not status updates. You can do that through our <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/heartbeats/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">Heartbeats Check-in</a> (or Slack, email, etc.)  Rather, one-on-one meetings are invaluable time for you as a leader to understand how an employee is feeling, so you best support them through remote work. You can help a team member overcome blockers, think a hard problem through, and make better progress – all in an effective one-on-one meeting.</p>



<p>To do this, here&#8217;s a one-on-one meeting agenda template that you can use during these tough times of COVID-19 and their transition to remote work:</p>



<p><em>Catching up (5 min.)</em></p>



<ul><li><em>How are you feeling with all the uncertainty lately?</em></li></ul>



<p><em> Concerns / Issues (20 min.)</em></p>



<ul><li><em>How do you feel about the workload? Where is it unreasonable?</em></li><li><em>Is there anything that feels troubling or concerning to you about the direction of the team?</em></li></ul>



<p><em> Feedback (20 min.)</em></p>



<ul><li><em>How are you feeling about this transition to remote work? Anything I can help make more clear?</em></li><li><em>What about my management style can I improve or adapt, to best support you during these times?</em></li></ul>



<p><em> Takeaways / Next Steps (5 min.)</em></p>



<p>Find this agenda template helpful?  We give you hundreds of one-on-one meeting question suggestions and agenda templates with our <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/one_on_ones/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">One-on-Ones Tool</a> in Know Your Team. You may want to check it out today. </p>



<p>Additionally, I&#8217;ve written an extensive &#8220;<a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/guides">Guide to Effective One-on-One Meetings</a>&#8221; based on data with 2,000+ people, that is available when you sign up for and upgrade to the full version of <a href="http://knowyourteam.com/m/features/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">Know Your Team</a>. </p>

<p>The time warp doesn&#8217;t have to happen. We don&#8217;t have to devolve our management practices to be more primitive or dystopian in an effort to &#8220;ensure productivity.&#8221;</p>



<p>Rather, we can do remote leadership the right way. We can default to trust – not tracking. We can focus on how we&#8217;re supporting our remote employees, not inadvertently holding them back. This the opportunity we have, with remote leadership. Let&#8217;s rise to it. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">In these troubling times, a lack of motivation at work might not only affect your employees – it can affect you as a leader, too. Consider these 5 tips.</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="445" src="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/low-motivation-1024x445.png" alt="lack of motivation at work as a manager" class="wp-image-5986"/></figure>



<p>You don&#8217;t want to be feeling it, but there it is:  A lack of motivation at work. <em>That</em>. You&#8217;ve noticed it bubbling up inside of you during these days of COVID-19, stronger than ever before.  </p>



<p>Your tasks feel drudging to complete. Your attention flickers back and forth. To your kids. To the news. To your spouse. To your parents&#8217; health. To <em>your</em> health.</p>



<p>As leaders, a lack of motivation at work is something we&#8217;re usually worried that our <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/03/4-reasons-good-employees-lose-their-motivation">team</a> will experience. </p>



<p>But during these troubling times, what about when <em>you</em> feel that lack of motivation at work as a manager, yourself?  </p>



<p>You&#8217;re not alone. As the CEO of <a href="http://knowyourteam.com/m/features/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">Know Your Team</a>, several people asked me a version of this question, &#8220;<em>What do I do if I&#8217;m feeling a lack of motivation as a manager?</em>&#8221; during our <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/workshops">Workshop Live! session</a> I held the other day on &#8220;How to Motivate Your Team.&#8221; </p>



<p>Well, it&#8217;s tricky. <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2019/09/06/how-to-motivate-employees-dont-do-this-instead/">Motivation</a> is personal. It&#8217;s different for each person. There&#8217;s no &#8220;playbook&#8221; for when you&#8217;re feeling a lack of motivation at work. </p>



<p>However, there are small ways to coax yourself gently to lean into the work that is in front of you. Slowly, you can overcome your lack of motivation at work. Here&#8217;s how. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Create a wedge.</h3>



<p>When&#8217;s the last time you took 10 minutes for yourself before diving into your work? </p>



<p>It&#8217;s been a while, hasn&#8217;t it? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>It&#8217;s okay. Now more than ever, you can benefit from what I call a &#8220;wedge&#8221; – a small sliver of time and space you carve out for yourself only. Not talking to anyone. Not scrolling through the news on your phone. Not checking Slack. </p>



<p>This could be 10 minutes before you check your email in the morning, to make yourself a cup of tea and breathe. </p>



<p>Or maybe, it&#8217;s at the end of the day. You give yourself 5 minutes to do a set of jumping jacks. Indulge in a piece of chocolate. Read a few pages from a novel you&#8217;ve been wanting to get into.</p>



<p>As silly or superficial as it might seem, recognize that motivation can&#8217;t come without creating some space for yourself. And these days, with most of us working from home amidst our partners, kids, and pets, that space is scarcer than ever before. </p>



<p>Yet if you find a wedge –&nbsp;a small slice in your workday just for you – you can start to chip into the rut of heaviness that is dampening your motivation. With a wedge of time, you can give yourself space to recenter, regroup, and retap into your own intrinsic motivation. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The weight is heavy –&nbsp;and you&#8217;re allowed to admit it.</h3>



<p>These are not normal times. Yet when we pretend that they are – that we can do things at the same speed, the same pace&nbsp;– the more likely we are to grow frustrated at our own inability to meet our own expectations we&#8217;ve created for ourselves.</p>



<p>Rather than letting the anxiety of &#8220;Oh my god, I&#8217;m not at my best right now&#8221; build and build… Acknowledge that you&#8217;re worn thin. You&#8217;re operating with less fuel.</p>



<p>For example, it could be as simple as saying the phrase to yourself: &#8220;<em>It&#8217;s okay.</em>&#8221; Or, &#8220;<em>You&#8217;re not alone</em>&#8221; or &#8220;<em>This is harder than usual right now</em>.&#8221;</p>



<p>When we&#8217;re yelling at ourselves to go faster and run harder without acknowledging how much heavier the weight is, we weigh ourselves down even further. In order for the weight to feel lighter, we have to first admit that it&#8217;s heavy in the first place.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reconnect to the aspects of the job that energize you. </h3>



<p>When you first said &#8220;yes&#8221; to this job as a manager, what was it about the role that excited you?  What sparked your eagerness to come into work that first Monday?</p>



<p>Perhaps it was the possibility of learning things you&#8217;d never learned before. Or perhaps it was the caliber of the folks you got to work with. Or perhaps it was your interest in the industry itself. Whatever stoked your inner fire in those first initial months (or years!), consider how you can reconnect to those elements. </p>



<p>Today, during these hard times, you might find that what energizes you the most are some of the incredible folks you get to work with on your team. They inspire you, support you, or productively push you. How can you find ways to strengthen your relationships with those folks? Can you do a favor for them? Or even, can you ask them for a hand on a project? Can you make sure to schedule a video meeting to just catch up on life? Or can you leave a fun response to a <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/social_questions/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">Social Question</a> in <a href="http://knowyourteam.com/m/features/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">Know Your Team</a> to build greater rapport with them?</p>



<p>Lean into the areas – and the people – that help us feel excited about the work again. It can be rejuvenating. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Seek out the people who benefit most from your work. </h3>



<p>When you&#8217;re feeling a lack of motivation at work as a manager, it can be easy to forget that there are people who benefit from your work. Customers who are grateful for your services and would be bummed if you weren&#8217;t around. Remembering those folks –&nbsp;and perhaps even finding ways to interact with them more – can help renew your sense of motivation. </p>



<p>For instance, can you envision doing more customer support than you typically do? Does it make sense for you to do a few personal reach-outs to clients and see how they&#8217;re doing? Or, even going back to re-read client testimonials can help remind us why we do the work we do – and bolter our own motivation.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Step away. </h3>



<p>Some of the leaders who I respect the most have shared with me how paramount it is to <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2019/04/24/work-on-the-business-and-not-in-the-business-as-leaders/">step away</a> from your work, a leader. Distance gives perspective. When we&#8217;re so in the weeds of the work, we cannot always accurately nor effectively see things as they are. As the saying goes: you can&#8217;t work <em>on</em> the business if you&#8217;re working <em>in</em> the business all the time.</p>



<p>Find a bit of time to step back, take stock, and reflect. Yes, even amidst these crazy times, you can likely find 30 minutes, to take a step back and reflect on the work, instead of just barreling forward. </p>



<p>I&#8217;ll never forget a mentor of mine shared with me this idea:  When we&#8217;re present with our team and interacting with them, we are in fact <em>receiving</em>. And when we step away and taking time for ourselves, we&#8217;re in fact <em>giving</em> to our team. </p>



<p><em>Give</em> to yourself and to your team by stepping away.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>Our lack of motivation at work as managers during these unprecedented times are natural and expected. Don&#8217;t push the feeling away –&nbsp;and don&#8217;t berate yourself for it. </p>



<p>Rather, try approaching your situation with patience and grace. We may not quite feel 100% like ourselves, but we can reconnect with certain aspects of ourselves and our work. </p>



<p>The ground isn&#8217;t quite solid right now, but over time, we can regain our footing. </p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>&#8220;I would love to use Know Your Team with <em>multiple</em> teams in my organization&#8230; What&#8217;s the best way to do that?&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p>I finally have the perfect answer for you.</p>



<p>Introducing &#8220;Teams.&#8221; It&#8217;s the easiest way to have multiple teams using <a href="http://knowyourteam.com/m/features/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">Know Your Team</a>.</p>



<p>Now it&#8217;s seamless for several – or all – of your teams using Know Your Team to live under the same account. </p>



<p>If you&#8217;ve been keen to roll-out out Know Your Team to your entire organization but weren&#8217;t sure how KYT would work with multiple teams, <a href="http://knowyourteam.com/m/features/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">now is the perfect time to give KYT a try</a>. All your managers can now benefit from our tools, organization-wide. </p>



<p>Or, if you already have several teams using Know Your Team, now you can have them all housed in a single account. This means, across teams, more of your fellow managers can <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/one_on_ones/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">hold one-on-one meetings</a>, get <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/heartbeats/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta;">status updates,</a> build <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/culture_questions/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">team rapport</a>, and more.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Let&#8217;s take a closer look…</h3>



<p>Here&#8217;s a peek at a sample organization called &#8220;Honcho Design&#8221; that has multiple teams in Know Your Team:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="http://knowyourteam.com/m/features/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="820" src="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/KYT-Teams-Screenshot-1-5-1024x820.png" alt="" class="wp-image-5960"/></a></figure>



<p></p>



<p>You can see they&#8217;ve got an organization called  &#8220;Honcho Design&#8221;, where they can turn on our KYT tools organization-wide. For example, you can use our <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/icebreakers/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">Icebreaker</a>, to help everyone get to know each other and onboard new hires, across the organization.  They also can use our <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/social_questions/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">Social Question</a> organization-wide, so that everyone feels more connected as they work remotely:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/icebreakers_2-1024x797-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5947" width="768" height="598"/></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Then, you&#8217;ll notice each of Honcho Design&#8217;s teams has a separate &#8220;Team&#8221; within Know Your Team – Design Team, Sales, Team, Engineering Team etc. As a manager, you can switch between the teams you&#8217;re a part of at any time:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="819" height="592" src="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-31-at-5.04.51-PM.png" alt="" class="wp-image-5976"/></figure>



<p></p>



<p>Within a team, each manager can use all our tools – specific just to that team. For example, each manager can use our <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/one_on_ones/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">One-on-Ones Tool</a>. But with &#8220;Teams,&#8221; managers can now also use our tools <em>across different teams</em>:  So the VP of Engineering can hold peer one-on-one meetings using our <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/one_on_ones/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">One-on-Ones Tool</a> with the VP of Design, and also hold <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2019/10/03/skip-level-meetings-what-they-are-and-exactly-how-to-run-them/">skip-level meetings</a> with other direct reports:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/one_on_ones_2-2-1024x811.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5948" width="768" height="608"/></figure>



<p>Within each team, a manager can also use our <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/heartbeats/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">Heartbeat Check-in</a> &nbsp;– a daily or weekly status update that&#8217;s shared with everyone in the team. The Heartbeat Check-in integrates with <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/slack">Slack</a> too, so it&#8217;s easy to stay in-the-know and aligned on what everyone in each team is working on:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/heartbeats_3-1-1024x811.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5949" width="768" height="608"/></figure>



<p>Ready to see this live with your teams – and not just &#8220;Honcho Design&#8221;?  Now is an ideal time to try KYT with several (or all!) of your teams. <a href="http://knowyourteam.com/m/features/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">Sign-up for Know Your Team today</a>, and give our new &#8220;Teams&#8221; feature a whirl.</p>



<p>Excited for you and more of your team to benefit from KYT  <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f603.png" alt="😃" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>The world sure has changed since I shared our last Heartbeat podcast episode in February. But I couldn’t be more excited to share this month’s interview with you…</p>

I’ve long admired 1Password not only for their incredible product (we’re customers, ourselves), but for their immensely empathetic, customer-focused culture as a remote company with 220+ people all over the world. In our conversation, Matt shares his perspective on what’s enabled 1Password to maintain their “organizational soul” as they’ve grown, and the things they’ve refused to compromise on as a company.</p>

<p>Sheesh, it&#8217;s been quite the week, hasn&#8217;t it? I&#8217;ve gotten numerous questions about managing remote teams, as more folks are transitioning to work from home for the first time.</p>

It’s an opportunity for managers, executives, and business owners to gain in-depth insights into management and leadership lessons.&nbsp;This month, we were curious regarding lessons in giving feedback –&nbsp;something we highly focus on here ourselves at <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/?utm_source=linkedin&amp;utm_medium=cta">Know Your Team</a>.</p>



<p>In January, we had an AMA with Tim Burgess, co-founder of <a href="https://shieldgeo.com/">Shield GEO</a>, a global employment organization that helps companies who want to hire someone in a country where they are unable to employ them directly.</p>



<p>Other past guests have included, <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2020/01/08/top-7-international-employment-lessons-from-ama-with-tim-burgess-co-founder-of-shield-geo/">Tim Burgess</a>, co-founder of <a href="https://shieldgeo.com/">Shield GEO</a>, <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2019/11/13/top-9-remote-work-lessons-from-ama-with-sara-sutton-ceo-and-founder-of-flexjobs/">Sara Sutton</a>, CEO, and Founder of <a href="http://www.flexjobs.com/">FlexJobs</a>, <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2019/10/03/top-7-leadership-lessons-from-ama-with-natalie-gould-cfo-of-balsamiq/">Natalie Gould</a>, CEO of <a href="https://balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a>, and <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2018/01/04/top-19-leadership-lessons-learned-from-the-watercooler-ama-with-david-heinemeier-hansson-dhh/">David Heinemeier Hansson</a> (DHH), CTO at <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a>.</p>



<p>Without further ado, I would like to tell you about our February AMA guest, <a href="https://twitter.com/annacarrollMSSW">Anna Carroll</a> of <a href="https://www.everydayfeedback.com/anna-carroll-founder">everydayfeedback.com</a>. Anna is an author, feedback coach, and speaker. She helps leaders and professionals speed up their cycles of feedback, improvement, and results, including training for how to give and receive helpful transparent feedback. An essential quality of her “everyday feedback” approach is lowering stress and building great relationships along the way.</p>

<p>Anna is passionate about researching future workplace trends and exploring the brain science and psychological factors that are key to making great feedback happen.</p>



<p>I learned so much following Anna’s AMA. Here are the top 8 lessons in giving feedback that I learned from her:</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p><strong>Question #1</strong>: <strong>Lessons in Giving Feedback</strong></p>



<p>“What could be the best ways/techniques to provide feedback in remote teams?</p>



<p>Working remotely is usually tricky, and misunderstanding might take place. I would highly appreciate it if you could provide some tips.”</p>



<p><strong>Anna&#8217;s Answer:</strong></p>



<p>This is a great question and topic! I just covered working with remote team members in my latest blog post. Here are some tips and strategies you want to keep in mind while working with someone you don’t meet with face-to-face.</p>



<ul><li>Always get to know remote team members on a personal basis. Spend extra time here and there to visit with each one about their progress, their opinions, personal interests, etc. Regularly cultivate your relationship with them and show you care.</li><li>Always go over the goal(s) you are both committed to and revisit their role before giving feedback.</li><li>Share the feedback as:<ul><li>1) a personal observation, </li><li>2) the impact you see on the work goals, and </li><li>3) suggested changes. As in: <em>“I notice you’re focusing time on new customers but not existing customers. We heard from two customers about their complaints and a few missed opportunities for repeat orders. Please make the rounds to contact your existing customers.</em></li></ul></li><li>Ask them to share their plan for how they can do what you’re asking and spend a little time discussing any needed clarification. Thank them for the helpful discussions and your positive expectations for better goal achievement with these plans implemented.</li><li>Ask them to send you an email to summarize the plans you discussed. Respond and clarify.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Question #2</strong>: <strong>Lessons in Giving Feedback</strong></p>



<p>“For someone who is new to management and giving feedback, what is the first skill or technique would you recommend they focus on to make sure their conversations are productive and helpful?”</p>



<p><strong>Anna&#8217;s Answer:</strong></p>



<p>Refer to your shared goals with people repeatedly. Be able to state them clearly and refer to them every time you give feedback. Being clear on shared goals prevents a lot of misunderstandings.</p>



<p><strong>Question #3</strong>: <strong>Lessons in Giving Feedback</strong></p>



<p>“An important quality of your “everyday feedback” approach is lowering stress. Why is this an important component of your approach and what are your favorite ways to alleviate stress?”</p>



<p><strong>Anna&#8217;s Answer:</strong></p>



<p>Everyday feedback naturally reduces stress because when we’re honest with people, they know what we’re thinking and trust us more. In turn, they will share their views with us more readily and there’s no pent-up hidden agenda between us. This makes everyone’s world more predictable and we’re able to relax more easily. So everyday feedback itself prevents and reduces stress.</p>



<p><strong>Question #4</strong>: <strong>Lessons in Giving Feedback</strong></p>



<p>“I’m growing a team of software developers and we recognize feedback as one of our values.</p>



<p>I’ve found myself repeating feedback several times.</p>



<ul><li>Is that common/expected?</li><li>Do you tackle this topic in your book/website?”</li></ul>



<p><strong>Anna&#8217;s Answer:</strong></p>



<p>Great inquiry re: repeating feedback. Unlike you, most leaders dread giving feedback so much that they want to forget it’s still needed (even though it’s usually overdue) and try to get onto a topic they find pleasant. So it’s not common because most leaders don’t bother to worry about feedback that was obviously not heard or not “gotten” by the receiver. You are clearly a true feedback devotee. I love it!</p>



<p>I tackle it in my book as we talk about opening up a continuous series of conversations with people on our team so that, in each conversation, we can address their progress on past feedback as well as new topics.</p>



<p>What is probably most helpful is for you or any leader giving feedback to set up a follow-up conversation in which you:</p>



<ul><li>Note and comment on ANY (though it may be small) positive steps the person has taken or tried to take since you gave the feedback the first time &amp; acknowledge any progress or efforts before making current observations.</li><li>Refer back to your shared goals with this person, as the receiver may not even be targeting the same things that matter to you. If that is the case, expand the discussion with them about these goals and why they’re important. For example, if they are into speed alone and don’t value documentation of what they are doing and trying, they won’t make progress on what you need them to do</li><li>Then share your observations of their behavior/work and the negative impacts you see</li><li>Try to diagnose where they are missing the message and ask for their views on what they see themselves doing to address these situations in the future. Open up a dialogue about how they can shift to what you are needing.</li><li>If progress is slow, you will need to break it into mini-steps and either sit down with them on each sub-step or assign them a partner/expert on the areas they need to learn.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Question #5</strong>: <strong>Lessons in Giving Feedback</strong></p>



<p>“I think we struggle most with giving critical feedback.</p>



<p>We currently have no managers (though we have team leads) which has made it feel awkward for some people to give difficult feedback to one another &#8211; it isn’t always clear if it is our “place” to do so.</p>



<p>We’ve been encouraging people to be brave to have these difficult discussions with one another, and are beginning to feel the benefit.</p>



<p>I think though, we may soon be adding more formal coaches/mentors (or possibly managers) to our structure. My concern is that people could lean on this too much and rely on the coach to have uncomfortable conversations. I would hate for these new coaches to end up being a tool people use to address issues they don’t want to deal with themselves.</p>



<p>What advice do you have to encourage peer-to-peer feedback, of course, positive feedback, but also for those more uncomfortable conversations?”</p>



<p><strong>Anna&#8217;s Answer:</strong></p>



<p>Thanks for chiming in on a challenging structure your company shares with several I’ve worked with over the last 10 years—manager-less organizations or self-managing teams. They add more complications than benefits, in my not-so-humble opinion.</p>



<p>We’ve been encouraging people to be brave to have these difficult discussions with one another, and are beginning to feel the benefit.</p>



<p>Congrats on that! You and your colleagues clearly see benefit from feedback and encouraging them to have courage is great!</p>



<p>I think though, we may soon be adding more formal coaches/mentors (or possibly managers) to our structure. My concern is that people could lean on this too much and rely on the coach to have uncomfortable conversations. I would hate for these new coaches to end up being a tool people use to address issues they don’t want to deal with themselves.</p>



<p>I share your exact concerns and have seen these concerns play out many times. The extreme is a majority-male professional cohort in which they bring in all-female HR-type coaches who are helpful and empathetic. The power resides in the professional group who are the ones avoiding giving the feedback. Leaders in such organizations (who are often technical experts who are extreme introverts and who find feedback painful to give) even preach how feedback is best given from a 3rd party coach and/or anonymously. I have even seen structures set up for the coaches to interview managers and others who give input in secret—away from the feedback receiver. Then the coach delivers the feedback while the receiver is trying to understand what Is really meant by the hidden input giver.</p>



<p>This is lunacy in my view, as it distorts the feedback information and teaches everyone that honest feedback is a horrid and hurtful process that people can’t share safely. I think that such an attempt at suppressing transparency actually sets the organization back and deprives the receiver of crucial information. What is truly needed is for everyone to learn how to give frequent, open feedback and benefit from it. Do it, practice it, follow up with it frequently, and knock down barriers and excuses for dishonesty. My workbook, The Everyday Feedback Workbook, available on Amazon has many tools and examples for how to create a positive climate for feedback.</p>



<p>What advice do you have to encourage peer-to-peer feedback, of course, positive feedback, but also for those more uncomfortable conversations?</p>



<p>For peer-to-peer feedback, it is crucial to review your shared stake in better performance from all involved. How is your work interrelated and what benefits can you both realize about helping one another get better? As a leader or influencer/role model, talk every day and every way about the value of feedback. Ask for it yourself, encourage discussions in meetings about how the group can improve on shared projects, and thank everyone when they give you or the whole group feedback.</p>



<p>Start doing it yourself by having simple feedback conversations with others about topics that will most improve performance and impact on the business goals. The faster you start having “small” but helpful conversations, the faster everyone will see the value and less afraid of sharing feedback with others. The secret is to have people who really believe in the helpfulness of the feedback start implementing it before demanding that leaders who dread giving feedback simply comply with an order. A lot more details are contained in my book, The Feedback Imperative: How to Give Everyday Feedback To Speed Up Your Team’s Success.</p>



<p><strong>Question #6</strong>: <strong>Lessons in Giving Feedback</strong></p>



<p>“To expand on the remote question, how do you tailor feedback when you can’t give it in the moment or face to face? i.e. how do you deliver feedback face to face vs video call vs email vs chat.</p>



<p>I struggle to pick which mode to use and also to move across those forms to give some feedback in the moment but carry the discussion into a better medium. e.g. give quick feedback via chat but dig deeper in a video call 1:1?”</p>



<p><strong>Anna&#8217;s Answer:</strong></p>



<p>Thanks for breaking it down into three different communication media/tools:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Face-to-face</li><li>Video call</li><li>Chat</li></ul>



<p>The first two feedback settings are very similar, except the signals in the video calls aren’t quite as simultaneous as with face to face. It takes slightly more time for the two people to get comfortable and feel in sync with the other person’s facial and voice signals. Usually, the awkwardness and “testing the waters” dissipates quickly, especially when the feedback giver starts with a personal exchange or refers to something enjoyable or funny that enters their emotional brain in a positive way and makes dissolves some of their trepidations.</p>



<p>It can be a reference to the weather, sports team, or a company event in the receiver’s home town to show you acknowledge their experience. You may also share a recent amusing anecdote that is relevant to the other person. Avoid being “ha-ha” funny or trying to distract from the topic at hand. Being your natural and authentic self, as in all good communication, is what’s vital.</p>



<p>As in all everyday feedback settings, jump in quickly and naturally, as in “I wanted to identify some ways we can focus more on the bigger potential customers. Here’s what I noticed this week about your allocation of time &amp; priorities. I recommend starting with these client leads and goals before handling all the other time-eating demands. How can you implement this in your typical workday?”</p>



<p>In all of these media formats, putting the feedback in context is essential. For one thing, you are showing them some of their challenges while articulating the rationale for why it’s important that they make the change.</p>



<p>With chat, make sure you can narrow down the feedback topic into something very specific. Refer to the exact time you observed something—their presentation this morning, the conference call we were on yesterday, a financial report you just received. Do not ever go into a general performance discussion on a chat, such as “I wanted to review your past quarter as I observe it and share some feedback for the next quarter going forward.” If you must lump together a significant time period (such as 3 months), you must schedule plenty of time for a personal call or video, and vow to yourself you will never hold back that long again.</p>



<p><strong>Question #7</strong>: <strong>Lessons in Giving Feedback</strong></p>



<p>“How can we encourage people who don’t give much feedback to participate more? As a manager, I think my healthiest relationships are the ones where I receive feedback as well as give it. But not everyone will give me feedback.”</p>



<p><strong>Anna&#8217;s Answer:</strong></p>



<p>Good point: Some folks are super reluctant to give feedback to a boss. They may be super shy and “shut-down” as part of their personality, they may have had a bad experience in the past, or they may be simply slow to trust the environment and culture in your team and company.</p>



<p>You can “prime the pump” in various ways:</p>



<p>Tell the whole group you will be asking each for some feedback as you really want to improve your impact. You may then refer to a comment one of your less-shy people made, thank them publicly, and share how helpful it’s been to focus on improving that area. You can even refer to more than one person on your team: “Several of you have pointed out how overly-assertive I am when we’re in sales calls with new customers. I tend to dominate the meeting and I am now trying to get back to my mission, which is to help you become independent sales professionals. To change, I am now sitting back and taking notes for the first 10 minutes of the meeting and when and if I jump in, doing it in a collaborative and empowering manner to keep you in the driver’s seat.” Thanks to all who said that.</p>



<p>In these ways, I am learning how to lead better. You are helping me do things in a more effective way for you guys. So please give me feedback when I ask you.</p>



<p>Then never betray their trust or argue defensively when they seem off-base in their feedback. Try to always find a way to use their feedback and thank them for their helpful comments.</p>



<p><strong>Question #8</strong>: <strong>Lessons in Giving Feedback</strong></p>



<p>“We are a software house with 100 people. We’ve been around since 2002, and as the company grew we started struggling with peer feedback. It seems that it is really difficult for us to give negative feedback to each other and so sometimes feedback grows into a castle of stress and negative feelings until something explodes.</p>



<p>During the last months, we’ve been writing our guiding principles, and we hope that this clear and common understanding of our culture will help us to give more sustained feedback.</p>



<p>We’ve been thinking if we should implement a tool to invite people to give formal feedback to each other every 3 or 4 months. What do you think about those processes? Is it good to also have formal moments of feedback, or should we only invest in everyday feedback?”</p>



<p><strong>Anna’s Answer:</strong></p>



<p>Congrats: You seem to value feedback for your group enough to be concerned when there are barriers. Remind your team members that feedback is simply information they can use to improve future outcomes. When they don’t give and receive accurate information, improvement is impossible. When it derails into emotional blow-ups it stops being information they can use to improve.</p>



<p>I’m afraid I have a negative view of adopting phone or online feedback apps that make it easy to give feedback anonymously or remotely. Because giving feedback has been a scary experience in the past for many people, and in particular, for shy or reluctant communicators, they are trying to hide behind anonymity and avoid day-to-day transparent and helpful communication. The keyword here is helpful. Keep all feedback helpful without being dishonest. If it’s given frequently, people aren’t shocked and feeling hurt.</p>



<p>Ask people to focus on one topic at a time for change. When you are about to give someone feedback, what one area would help you two get your shared goal accomplished better? Be helpful in having a suggestion you think they can manage before dumping a laundry list of criticisms on them. A good reference is my Everyday Feedback Workbook, which has readers answering questions and using tools that guide you to honest, direct, and helpful feedback. </p>

Here&#8217;s why a daily stand-up meeting doesn&#8217;t work and what to do instead.</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="519" src="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/daily-stand-up-1-1024x519.png" alt="Daily stand-up meeting" class="wp-image-5565"/></figure>



<p>&#8220;Is this daily stand-up meeting over yet?&#8221; </p>



<p>The meeting is only 8 minutes in and no one has uttered those words outright&#8230;. but they don&#8217;t need to. Each of your team members&#8217; faces is blank. Mouths are moving, shaping the words, &#8220;what I worked on&#8221; and &#8220;what my blockers are,&#8221; but no one is truly listening.</p>



<p>This is the reality of daily stand-up meetings. And it might be <em>your</em> reality as a manager. </p>



<p>As a manager, you&#8217;ve likely witnessed this first hand. Your daily stand-up meetings have become bloated and unengaging, the more time passes and the bigger your team grows.</p>



<p>Should you be doing something different? And if so, what?</p>



<p>Based on the research we&#8217;ve collected amongst the 15,000+ managers and employees who use <a href="https://canopy.is/m/training?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=kill-daily-stand-ups">Canopy</a>, the answer is a resounding &#8220;yes.&#8221;</p>



<p>The time to kill the daily stand-up meeting has come. Here&#8217;s exactly why and what we should do instead&#8230;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-a-daily-stand-up-meeting-doesn-t-work">Why a daily stand-up meeting doesn&#8217;t work</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-many-oars-too-many-directions">Many oars, too many directions </h3>



<p>The original <em>intention</em> behind a daily stand-up meeting is extremely sound. Popularized by the <a href="https://www.cprime.com/resources/what-is-agile-what-is-scrum/">Agile methodology</a> of project management, daily stand-up meetings are meant to share progress and identify any blockers the team is facing. For the few teams who strictly adhere to only sharing status updates and blockers, a daily stand-up can serve them well.</p>



<p>However, for most of us in practice, it&#8217;s a different story. We get overly excited and cram other intentions into our daily stand-ups:  We want them to be an energizing morale booster for the team, a time to reflect on what went well, an opportunity for team members who don&#8217;t regularly talk to each other to feel connected&#8230; Woah, woah, woah. No wonder daily stand-up meetings start to run over, with folks rambling, and people disengaging. </p>



<p>The best meetings are laser-focused focused on either (1) sharing information (2) making decisions or (3) building rapport. Try to do all three at the same time, and you end up having too many oars, rowing in too many directions. A bloated, ineffective meeting manifests. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-20-hours-down-the-drain-per-week">20 hours down the drain per week </h3>



<p>Say you are able to miraculously, consistently hold 10 &#8211; 15 minute daily stand-up meetings with your team. &#8220;Great!&#8221; you think to yourself. &#8220;That doesn&#8217;t feel like a lot of time.&#8221; As you switch gears to dig back into your work, what you <em>don&#8217;t</em> realize is a study from the <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~gmark/chi08-mark.pdf">University of California Irvine</a> revealed that it takes an average of 23 minutes and 15 seconds to get back to the task at hand. </p>



<p>This means the time a team member needs to recoup from the daily stand-up is longer than the daily stand-up meeting itself. That&#8217;s an irreversible 25 minutes taken away from every single one of your team members every week. So if you have 10 team members, that&#8217;s 20 hours poured down the drain. Is the cost of the interruption worth it?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lack-of-recorded-history">Lack of recorded history </h3>



<p>Someone calls in sick and can&#8217;t make the daily stand-up meeting. A <a href="https://canopy.is/m/training_modules/9-how-to-lead-well-remotely?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=kill-daily-stand-ups">remote</a> employee can&#8217;t participate in the daily stand-up because it&#8217;s 1AM their local time when it&#8217;s 9AM for the rest of the team. How do you ensure that everyone is on the same page, especially as your team grows and becomes more spread out? With daily stand-up meetings being in-person or over Zoom, you lack a shared recorded history of the progress being made.</p>



<p>This particularly becomes apparent when someone new joins the team. You&#8217;d love to be able to share the week-to-week progress the team has made to give them full context on a project&#8230; But with daily stand-ups meetings, that history is scattered in a series of haphazard notes at best and doesn&#8217;t provide the new hire a complete picture.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-so-what-to-do-instead">So what to do instead?</h2>



<p>There are a few options for either replacing your daily stand-up meeting and/or alternatives to holding them&#8230;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-automate-status-updates-with-a-tool">Automate status updates with a tool.</h3>



<p>Status updates are a critical part of ensuring everyone on the team is on the same page. But they don&#8217;t need to happen during an in-person daily stand-up meeting. (Remember the 20 hours down the drain!)</p>



<p>Instead, you can ask folks to take 30 seconds to write a few bullet points on what they worked on yesterday, what they plan to work on today, and any blockers they have. They can answer on their own time when it makes sense for them –&nbsp;and it doesn&#8217;t interrupt their workflow.</p>



<p>Here at <a href="https://canopy.is/m/training?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=kill-daily-stand-ups">Canopy</a>, we use our own tool internally for this. It&#8217;s called the <a href="https://canopy.is/m/tools/heartbeats?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=kill-daily-stand-ups">Heartbeat Check-in</a>. It sends an email or Slack message every day asking, &#8220;What are you working on today?&#8221; I take a minute to fill out and find that, personally, it helps me orient my day without pulling my attention away from the work itself.</p>



<p>You can customize the Heartbeat Check-in questions to be more specifically geared toward your team (e.g., &#8220;What&#8217;s something that might be blocking you today?&#8221;) and change the frequency to be as often as you&#8217;d like. With the Heartbeat Check-in, you also have a complete recorded history of everyone&#8217;s progress over time.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-use-a-monthly-all-hands-or-weekly-staff-meeting-to-focus-on-other-functions">Use a monthly all-hands or weekly staff meeting to focus on other functions.</h3>



<p>You&#8217;ve likely realized that, although well-intended, you have too many varying purposes for your original daily stand-up meeting (e.g., you wanted to align the team around a vision <em>and</em> help build rapport in the team). Decide what specific functions are most important in your team to foster, and then devote other meetings, processes, or tools to fulfilling these functions. </p>



<p>For example, here are functions you could incorporate into a monthly all-hands meeting or weekly staff meeting&#8230;</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Reflection</strong>: Use a weekly staff meeting to encourage shared reflection about what could be better. For example, you could pose the question, <em>&#8220;Knowing what we know now, what would you change about how we approached this project?&#8221;</em></li>



<li><strong>Recognition</strong>:  Take time during a monthly all-hands meeting to highlight positive progress that&#8217;s been made. You could ask, for instance, <em>&#8220;What&#8217;s something you&#8217;ve been surprised or encouraged to see us accomplish?</em>&#8221; or <em>&#8220;When is a moment you&#8217;ve felt proud of working at XXX, and why?&#8221;</em></li>



<li><strong>Connection</strong>:  Carve out some time during the all-hands or staff meeting to enable people to connect with what they enjoy most about working on the team. You could ask fun non-work related questions like, <em>&#8220;What&#8217;s the thing you bought with your own money?&#8221;</em> or <em>&#8220;Who&#8217;s the most famous person you&#8217;ve met?&#8221;</em></li>



<li><strong>Vision</strong>: Use an all-hands meeting to align folks in your team around vision and how each team member contributes to that vision. For example, you could ask your team: <em> &#8220;If someone were to ask you what the vision of our company is, would a clear answer come to mind? How do you feel your individual work is contributing to that vision?&#8221;</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here are some <a href="https://canopy.is/blog/2019/06/27/what-to-put-on-your-team-meeting-agenda/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=kill-daily-stand-ups">other suggestions for what to put on your all-hands team meeting agenda</a>, if you were curious.</p>



<p>Naturally, there is no one right way to share progress in your team –&nbsp;and you&#8217;ll know best what is going to work for <em>your</em> team. </p>



<p>But least of all, I hope you don&#8217;t carry on with daily stand-up meetings merely because you&#8217;re &#8220;already doing it&#8221;. The best process results from what is deliberate and thoughtful – not what is convenient and familiar. </p>



<p>Daily stand-up meetings are an antiquated relic. It&#8217;s time to sunset them.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">If you&#8217;re a new manager, focus on these 3 tips for new managers and nothing else. </h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="446" src="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/3-essential-tips-1024x446.png" alt="3 essential tips for new managers" class="wp-image-5505"/></figure>



<p>&#8220;Help!  I&#8217;m a new manager and have so much going on&#8230; Can you give me some tips for new managers?&#8221;</p>



<p>A version of this sentiment is expressed to me at least several times a day. I share this not jocularly, but rather out of solidarity:  Whether or not &#8220;Help!&#8221; has audibly emerged from your mouth, know that you&#8217;re not alone.</p>



<p>Figuring out how to become a good new manager is like being thrown into a swimming pool. Someone&#8217;s saying you need to have a faster backstroke time, someone else is telling you that you need to improve your butterfly stroke&#8230; Except there&#8217;s one problem:  You don&#8217;t even know how to float. </p>



<p>As a new manager, you are rarely given support and guidance on how to be a good manager. You have no clue what to focus on first –&nbsp;let alone how to master the basics. You&#8217;re simply expected to know how to float in the pool automatically, compete in the top races, and win them. </p>



<p>But is this a sport you have any chance of excelling at?</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve got good news – and some hope. I&#8217;ve spent my entire working life studying managers, and what I&#8217;ve learned from almost 10 years of researching and working with thousands of managers through <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/">Know Your </a><a href="http://knowyourteam.com/m/features/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">Team</a> is that there are a few key tips for new managers – three in particular – that you&#8217;ll want to prioritize.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Here are the 3 things you&#8217;ll want to focus on first as a manager:</h4>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1:-trust">#1:  Trust</h3>



<p>Trust is foundational for a team to operate well. Think of it as the oil of the machine in your team:  Without it, nothing can run smoothly.  As a result, building trust with your team should be your <em>first</em> focus as a new manager. </p>



<p>Building trust likely feels intuitive to you, as a new manager. However, what we often don&#8217;t realize is that there are two <em>types</em> of trust we need to foster in our team to be effective as a leader: (1) &#8220;<a href="http://jwalkonline.org/docs/Grad%20Classes/Survey/articles/psyclimate/noted/org%20comm%20scale.pdf">affective trust</a>&#8220;, a form of trust based on the emotional bond and relatedness you feel toward another person and (2) &#8220;cognitive trust&#8221;, which emerges from a sense of reliability and competence.</p>



<p>To be a successful new manager, you need both affective and cognitive trust in your team. This means, as a new manager, to build affective trust, it&#8217;s critical that you create opportunities for your team members to get to know each other better, find commonalities, and share things about yourself, as well. To build cognitive trust, you&#8217;ll want to be vulnerable and transparent about your intentions and follow-through on them. You&#8217;ll want to show your team that they can count on you and that you&#8217;re not making empty promises.</p>



<p>Affective trust is especially important to initiate at the beginning of a relationship, according to <a href="http://jwalkonline.org/docs/Grad%20Classes/Survey/articles/psyclimate/noted/org%20comm%20scale.pdf">research</a>. Because of this, you&#8217;ll want to devote keen attention to this type of trust when you first join the team as a new manager.</p>



<p><strong>Looking for a way to scale build affective trust in a personal way? </strong>You&#8217;ll want to use our <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/icebreakers/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">Icebreaker</a> and <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/social_questions/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">Social Question Tool</a> in Know Your Team. We ask non-cheesy get-to-know-you questions that help spark connection and rapport in your team.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2:-honesty">#2:  Honesty</h3>



<p>The second thing you&#8217;ll want to focus on as a new manager is communicating honestly. Your team cannot make sound decisions if everyone isn&#8217;t able to freely give critical feedback, share candid observations, and be open with one another. </p>



<p>To enable honest communication, you&#8217;ll want to establish two mechanisms in your team as a new manager:  (1) recurring <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/one_on_ones/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">one-on-one meetings</a> with each direct report and (2) a system of asking regular <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/culture_questions/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">employee pulse questions</a>. The combination of both of these mechanisms will help you open up channels of dialogue with folks 1:1, and elicit honest feedback outside of an annual review process. </p>



<p>One-on-one meetings are markedly paramount for you, as a new manager. In a 2018 survey we conducted with 1,182 managers and 838 employees, we found that almost 90% of managers believed that one-on-one meetings positively affect team performance. To ensure that <em>you</em> are leveraging one-on-one meetings in a way that most benefits your team, you&#8217;ll want to invest in properly <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2020/01/22/youve-got-your-first-one-on-one-meeting-with-an-employee-how-to-prepare/">preparing for these 1-on-1 meetings</a>.  For example, are the questions that you&#8217;re asking specific enough and focused on getting a status update? If not, here are the <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2018/01/11/the-8-best-questions-to-ask-during-a-one-on-one-meeting/">8 best questions to ask in a one-on-one meeting</a>. </p>



<p><strong>What else can you do to ensure you make the most of your one-on-one meetings?  </strong>Use our hundreds of suggested questions and agenda templates in our <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/one_on_ones/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">One-on-Ones Tool</a> in Know Your Team to help you prepare methodically for your one-on-one meetings.</p>



<p>Beyond one-on-one meetings, you can communicate honestly as a new manager by actively asking insightful questions to your entire team on a regular basis. When you ask for feedback regularly – instead of just relying on a twice-a-year 50-question survey&nbsp;– you&#8217;re creating a rhythm and habit for people to be weighing in honestly. </p>



<p>You can use our <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/culture_questions/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">Company Question</a> Tool in Know Your Team to get the honest, regular feedback you&#8217;re looking for. We give you hundreds of questions to ask such as, &#8220;<em>What do you think the team is behind the curve on?</em>&#8221; or &#8220;<em>Have you noticed good work go unappreciated recently?</em>&#8221; that are asked one a time, either once a week, biweekly or monthly through email or Slack.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3:-context">#3: Context</h3>



<p>Of all the tips for new managers, here is the one tip new managers overlook most often:  You have to create context for your team. Your team won&#8217;t be able to get to where you want to go if they don&#8217;t know <em>where</em> they&#8217;re going –&nbsp;and what&#8217;s going on. Numerous experienced managers have told me that this is the one thing they wish they would&#8217;ve committed to earlier.</p>



<p>Specifically, you&#8217;ll want to create context around two areas within your team:  (1) Progress (&#8220;what&#8217;s going on?&#8221;) and (2) Vision (&#8220;where are we going?&#8221;). </p>



<p>Progress is integral to share, given that making meaningful progress at work has been <a href="https://hbr.org/2011/05/the-power-of-small-wins">shown</a> to be the strongest source of motivation for employees. To consistently share progress, you&#8217;ll first want to figure out a system for everyone to know what everyone else is working on. Many teams will hold daily stand-up meetings or weekly staff meetings to share status updates. But these meetings quickly become bloated and aren&#8217;t sustainable as the team grows in size. </p>



<p><strong>Instead, here&#8217;s the easiest way to efficiently share status updates in a team: </strong> Use our <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/heartbeats/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">Heartbeats Tool</a> that automates daily or weekly status updates in your team via email or Slack. Personally, it&#8217;s saved my team dozens of hours every single month.</p>



<p>As time passes, vision will also be essential to co-create and clarify because it codifies what you the team is making progress toward. However, it&#8217;s something to focus on <em>later</em>. Many new managers make the mistake of hastily charting a vision because they want to be seen as competent from the get-go. This massively backfires because your team is wary of any shiny new direction being imposed. </p>



<p>Instead, your first weeks (and months!) as a new manager should be spent going on a <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2018/06/06/what-to-do-and-not-do-during-your-first-2-weeks-as-a-new-manager/">&#8220;Listen and learn&#8221; tour</a> with your team, to uncover what <em>they</em> think is going well, isn&#8217;t going well, and where the team should be headed. After you&#8217;ve fully heard folks out in your team, then you can begin the process of co-creating vision and what a picture of success for your team looks like (<a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2017/07/25/what-is-company-vision-a-picture-of-a-better-place/">I talk about this process here</a>).</p>

<p></p>



<p>After studying managers for almost the past 10 years, I&#8217;ve consistently found that becoming a good manager always comes back to these 3 things:  Trust, Honesty, Context.</p>



<p>New managers, keep it simple. Take these tips for new managers to heart and focus on trust, honesty, and context first.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="371" src="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/16-coaching-1-1-questions-1024x371.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5470"/></figure>



<p>The key to coaching employees lies in a single, straightforward choice:  The 1-on-1 meeting questions you choose to ask.</p>



<p>You may be raising an eyebrow at this. Surely, you&#8217;ve heard enough hype about how &#8220;you need to be holding one-on-ones as a leader.&#8221; But the role that one on one meetings play in coaching employees is egregiously overlooked.</p>



<p>One-on-one meeting questions are possibly the most effective mechanism we have as leaders for <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/11/the-leader-as-coach">coaching</a> employees. When we invest in asking the right questions during our 1-on-1 meetings, our tendency to <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2019/05/01/am-i-micromanaging-my-team/">micromanage</a> our team can be circumvented.</p>



<p>For instance, if we incessantly ask &#8220;<em>What&#8217;s the latest on X</em>?&#8221; or &#8220;<em>When will this be finished?&#8221;</em> during a one-on-one meeting, and we&#8217;ll likely come across as overbearing.</p>



<p>But choose to ask <a href="http://knowyourteam.com/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=inline_link">the <em>right</em> 1-on-1 questions</a> (I share 16 of them below in the &#8220;Ask these questions&#8230;&#8221; section), and you help that employee feel encouraged about their work and equipped to go solve the problems ahead of them. </p>



<p>Let me show you what I mean. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-focus-on-these-4-things-in-your-1-1s-to-coach-your-team">Focus on these 4 things in your 1-1s to coach your team.</h3>



<p>First, to coach your employees, your one-on-one meetings should be focused on understanding a few things:</p>



<p><strong>Their perception of the current state: </strong> How does your team member see themselves and their performance? Ask questions during your one on one meeting that gives you ample information about their point-of-view of how they currently see their work situation. It&#8217;s massively important to understand this, otherwise, you won&#8217;t be able to coach someone to make progress. </p>



<p><strong>The ideal outcome of where they need to be: </strong> How does where your team member is currently at, match up to where they need to be, in terms of their performance?  You want to get clear on what &#8220;success&#8221; is –&nbsp;and if the other person understands this too. Ask 1-on-1 questions that reveal to you both how you know when a project has been successful.</p>



<p><strong>What your team member is most motivated by:  </strong>What does your team member seem to want most for themselves, professionally? What do they seem to be most motivated by? A big part of coaching employees well is being in tune with what the other person ultimately cares about. Their aspirations can help you ask questions to help the other person remember and zoom in on this for themselves.</p>



<p><strong>What&#8217;s holding your team member back: </strong> What&#8217;s likely holding them back from where they need to be, in terms of their performance, and/or from what they desire most professionally?  The best coaching one on one questions illuminate how the person is either (1) unintentionally holding themselves back or (2) hasn&#8217;t considered a problem from a different angle. By asking questions around what&#8217;s getting in the way, you can help an employee see for themselves how to solve a problem.</p>



<p>Focus on gaining clarity in these four areas, and you&#8217;ll be able to coach an employee during a one-on-one meeting. By the 1-on-1 questions you ask, you&#8217;ll help a person see obstacles in a new light, and come to the right conclusion themselves.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ask-these-16-one-on-one-meeting-questions-to-help-coach-your-team">Ask these 16 one on one meeting questions to help coach your team.</h3>



<p>All right. You&#8217;ve got the framework for approaching coaching employees during a one-on-one meeting.  Ready for the exact <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2019/10/10/the-5-mistakes-youre-making-in-your-one-on-one-meetings-with-direct-reports/">1-on-1</a> questions that I recommend asking? </p>



<p>Here are the 16 questions you should ask if you want to coach your employees during a 1-on-1:</p>



<p>First, ask questions that reveal how do they see themselves and their performance…</p>



<ul><li><em>How have you been feeling about your performance lately?</em></li><li><em>In your view, did anything fall short of your own expectations? </em></li><li><em>In your view, did anything fall short of the team&#8217;s expectations? </em></li></ul>



<p>Then, ask questions that reveal where they need to be…</p>



<ul><li><em>Is it clear to you what is &#8220;quality&#8221; work?</em></li><li><em>Is it clear what &#8220;success&#8221; ultimately looks like?</em></li><li><em>How do you know you will have been successful?</em></li></ul>



<p>Afterward, ask questions that reveal what they want most…</p>



<ul><li><em>What motivates you the most about this project?</em></li><li><em>What have you been most proud of what you&#8217;ve worked on?</em></li><li><em> What&#8217;s been energizing you lately about the team, if anything?</em></li></ul>



<p>Lastly, ask questions that reveal what&#8217;s likely holding them back…</p>



<ul><li><em>What do you find most demotivating about this project?</em></li><li><em>What are your biggest time wasters?</em></li><li><em>What do you feel confused about?</em></li><li><em>How am I unintentionally getting in the way of progress?</em></li><li><em>Is there anything that feels harder than it needs to be?</em></li><li><em>Is there an easier way to do what you suggested?</em></li><li><em>Is there another solution that isn’t immediately apparent?</em></li></ul>

<p>From these questions, surprising and meaningful insights will emerge. You&#8217;ll help your direct report realize that they tend to rush their work. You&#8217;ll help them see that a problem they were stuck on wasn&#8217;t so insolvable after all. And, you may also learn that there are in fact things <em>you</em> as a leader are unintentionally doing to hold someone back from doing their best work <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>This is all part of coaching employees well. After all, at its core, coaching is about helping your team figure something out, themselves. Coaching enables the agency they <em>already</em> have. You&#8217;re not doing the work for your team when you&#8217;re coaching employees –&nbsp;you&#8217;re helping a team solve problems for themselves, and make the best choice on their own. </p>



<p>There&#8217;s truly no better way to do this than by asking the <a href="http://knowyourteam.com/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=inline_link">right 1-on-1 meeting questions</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Heartbeat Podcast: A chat with Dr. Jennifer Goldman-Wetzler, Ph. D.</h2>



<p>It’s my true pleasure to welcome conflict expert,&nbsp;<a href="https://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiNjA4MzM5OCIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiNGF0OGQ0djdyeHo5dWxocHg2dTEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2plbmdvbGRtYW53ZXR6bGVyLmNvbS8_X19zPXdiYXRiaHZ1cXByazJwZmZzbXZ5In0">Dr. Jennifer Goldman-Wetzler, Ph. D.</a>, to the Heartbeat podcast today. As the Founder + CEO of Alignment Strategies Groups, Dr. Goldman-Wetzler has worked with leaders and teams at global corporations and nonprofits, including IBM, Intel, Barclays, Oxfam America and the United Nations. Most recently she wrote the book, “<a href="https://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiNjA4MzM5OCIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiNGF0OGQ0djdyeHo5dWxocHg2dTEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2plbmdvbGRtYW53ZXR6bGVyLmNvbS90aGUtYm9vaz9fX3M9d2JhdGJodnVxcHJrMnBmZnNtdnkifQ">Optimal Outcomes</a>” (which comes out on the 25th!) detailing strategies for freeing yourself from conflict. I was delighted to get to chat with her. We discussed leaders&#8217; ideal values vs. shadow values, the role that emotions play in conflict, and the steps we can take to extricate ourselves from conflict in the workplace.</p>

First, there was a stark difference between how much managers appreciated employees and how appreciated employees felt. We speculate that the illusion of transparency, or people’s tendency to overestimate how visible their emotions are to others, explains this: Managers incorrectly assumed employees knew how they felt about them.”&nbsp;Written by Kerry Roberts Gibson, Kate O’Leary, Joseph R.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">From our 1,000+ managers all over the world in our <a href="https://thewatercooler.io">Watercooler</a> community, here are 4 valuable management lessons that I’ve personally learned already this year.</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="429" src="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/4-leadership-lessons-january-1024x429.png" alt="Management lessons" class="wp-image-5170"/></figure>



<p>Management lessons are everywhere. You can read them in books, listen to them on podcasts, and hear them live during conference talks. Don’t get me wrong, these are all great ways to learn! The problem is, you can’t easily follow-up with famous authors, podcast hosts, and speakers. This is why we at <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/">Know Your Team</a> created The Watercooler: a unique, and highly-moderated community for 1000+ managers, leaders, executives, (and you!) to share and discuss management lessons, talk about challenges in the workplace, and support one another through our wins and losses.</p>



<p>As I said last year, in my post ‘<a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2019/10/16/three-lessons-on-leadership/">The 3 lessons on leadership I’ve learned from 1,000 managers in the past few months</a>,’ when I started here at Know Your Team as Operations Manager, I had no formal management training whatsoever. <a href="https://thewatercooler.io">The Watercooler</a> community has become an essential part of my workday and education in my new management role. There are thousands of conversations that I can learn from.</p>



<p>Here are four of the <strong>best</strong> conversations and top management lessons, I’ve learned from and that we’ve been having in <a href="https://thewatercooler.io/">The Watercooler</a> in January 2020 <em>alone</em>:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Lesson #1: What are common</strong><strong> pitfalls and mistakes to avoid when doing manager handoffs and transitions?</strong></h3>



<p>People come and go in the workplace for various reasons. Maybe you’ve been promoted and are transitioning into a different role. Perhaps you’re taking leave for one reason or another. Regardless of the reason, you’ll want to make sure you’re structuring transitions to be as smooth as possible for yourself, the new person, and your team that they’ll be taking over.</p>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/planetburgess">Tim Burgess</a>, co-founder at <a href="http://shieldgeo.com/">Shield GEO,</a> said, &#8220;I think going too fast is the biggest pitfall.&#8221;</p>



<p>Additionally, he suggested:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Writing out all the things</strong> that you currently do in your role, monitor it for a few weeks to make sure you don&#8217;t miss anything and create good documentation for your role.</li><li><strong>Give a quick win</strong> with a process improvement or an initiative that the team has wanted for a while but he hasn&#8217;t had the bandwidth to do.</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jonnymccormick">Jonny McCormick</a> of <a href="http://www.spokepodcast.org/">spokepodcast.org</a>, Founder and Director of People &amp; Organization Development at <a href="https://www.rosseau.co/">Rosseau</a> added:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Give people milestones to strive for:</strong> &#8220;When you achieve XYZ, when you’re competent in ABC, or when you feel comfortable with DEF, we will increase your accountability.&#8221;</li><li><strong>Be clear on delegation, accountability, responsibility, and monitoring.</strong> Typically the most difficult things are delegation, accountability, and monitoring because they’re less commonly defined when compared to responsibility. Here’s how he thinks of it:&nbsp;<ul><li><strong>Delegation –</strong> Jonny points to this article on the <a href="https://www.inc.com/peter-economy/5-levels-of-remarkably-effective-delegation.html">5 Levels of Delegation</a>. Be clear on what is being delegated and to what level.</li><li><strong>Accountability –</strong> This happens in both directions (up and down the hierarchy) and can typically be tied to concrete outcomes. Being clear on what this role has accountability for delivering allows a person to come out swinging and plan appropriately.</li><li><strong>Monitoring –</strong> It’s worth being clear about how the role will be monitored long-term (e.g. performance reviews), but it&#8217;s crucially important to define how it will be monitored in the early days (e.g. weekly check-ins, continuous feedback, and agree upon next steps, etc.)</li></ul></li><li><strong>As for handling the transition publicly:</strong> What gets announced in the company is significant as well.&nbsp;<ul><li><strong>What is the symbolic date of handover</strong> where this person has full ownership and authority on all decision-making?&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Timing:</strong> Does the announcement get made initially on Day 1 that there’s a new role, and that a phased transition is in place with the expectation that by the end – Day 30, 60, or 90 – there is clarification of what this new role now has full accountability for?</li></ul></li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Lesson #2: What are some good ways of showing you value your employees?</strong></h3>



<p>Showing you truly, genuinely value your employees in thoughtful ways can make all the difference to a person’s happiness and contentment in your workplace. Watercooler members shared the little extra things they do as managers to show they care about their team:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Give them back their time.</strong> Maybe a Monday or a Friday is right on the cusp of a holiday, but it isn&#8217;t <em>technically</em> a holiday. Perhaps some people are even taking off on purpose to get a head start for family preparations, travel, etc. Consider turning it into a free paid &#8220;bonus holiday&#8221; to show your appreciation.</li><li><strong>Give shoutouts.</strong> In Slack, you could create a channel just for this purpose alone. Encourage folks to give whenever and as often as they see fit. You could even take those shoutouts and include them in an internal newsletter to provide people additional recognition.</li><li><strong>Simply express gratitude.</strong> Thanking people is probably the easiest, lowest cost, and yet hardest thing to do authentically. The challenge is you want to do it in the moment and not to make it systematic (otherwise you lose authenticity).</li><li><strong>Write hand-written notes.</strong> Pen a quick note with some kind thoughts, words of encouragement or gratitude, or anything else that might be appropriate and mail it or hand-deliver it. People appreciate the personal nature, thoughtfulness, and the little extra time it takes as opposed to a quick-worded Email or a Twitter message. You could even take pictures of the cards before sending, and occasionally go back and reminisce to warm the heart. Win-win.</li></ul>



<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f9e0.png" alt="🧠" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Goal idea for 2020:</strong> Pen at least one handwritten card each week. One member feels it will help him maintain a level of gratitude and diminish the ego.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Lesson #3: Should you be conducting pulse surveys?</strong></h3>



<p>A member was concerned because they were not receiving as many company health survey responses as they were striving to. Once again, member <a href="https://twitter.com/jonnymccormick">Jonny McCormick</a> of <a href="http://www.spokepodcast.org/">spokepodcast.org</a>, Founder and Director of People &amp; Organization Development at <a href="https://www.rosseau.co/">Rosseau</a>, gave the following solid advice:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Almost all companies suffer from survey overload. </strong>The bigger the company, the more surveys. It’s impossible to respond to them all.&nbsp;<ul><li>Tips:&nbsp;<ul><li>Is your survey sufficiently short?&nbsp;</li><li>Can it be anonymous?&nbsp;</li><li>Are there any additional barriers to entry? (i.e: sign-in page, reading instructions, etc.)&nbsp;</li><li>The less friction, the more likely you’ll get completion.)</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Do people have faith in the surveys?</strong> Perhaps people aren’t completing them because they don’t have faith that anything will change. Perhaps they are content with the status quo and, therefore, don’t see the point in the surveys.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>Some tips on increasing participation if you want to continue down the survey route:</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Have leaders model the behavior: </strong>i.e., Writing a quick email to their teams saying <em>“I’ve just completed X it took me Y mins and I think you should do it too…it’ll really help with Z.”</em></li><li><strong>Have a reward for participation:</strong> i.e., Giving away random gift cards or something else to encourage others.</li><li><strong>Show you’re listening:</strong> Do something with the feedback you receive. If someone takes the time to fill in a survey, they&#8217;ll want to understand it’s been listened to (even if the action isn’t the course they would have wanted!)</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Lesson #4: What are some frameworks for better communication?</strong></h3>



<p>It’s never fun having hard conversations with employees, but in The Watercooler, members discussed helpful frameworks and other reading material that might help you start to hold better tough conversations with employees and team members:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.brightvibes.com/1281/en/the-best-way-to-confront-people-is-by-saying-these-3-things">Simon Senek: The Best Way to Confront People is by Saying These 3 Things</a><ul><li>&#8220;Say exactly how they made you feel. Happy/sad/angry isn’t enough. Be specific.&#8221;</li><li>&#8220;Share the specific action that made you feel that way. &#8216;When you walked out on Friday night&#8230;'&#8221;</li><li>&#8220;Explain the impact of their actions. &#8216;I feel this threatens a stable future&#8230;'&#8221;</li></ul></li><li>Acknowledge how you feel and work out how you would <em>like</em> to feel. Then do the same for the other person or people in the conversation. Ask yourself, &#8220;how might they feel, and how would I like them to feel?&#8221; One of our members has been playing with a tool called <a href="https://theemotionalculturedeck.com/">&#8220;The Emotional Culture Deck&#8221;</a> to facilitate these conversations.</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Difficult-Conversations-Discuss-What-Matters/dp/0143118447">Difficult Conversations: How To Discuss What Matters Most by Douglas Stone, Bruce Patton, and Sheila Heen</a>.</li><li>The moment you have the urgency to talk and get your voice heard is the moment when you need to be listening to the other person the most.</li><li>Sometimes, we talk over each other because we fear that “our turn” might not come. That is not true. The more patient you are, the better the conversation will flow.</li><li>Use phrases like “Help me understand&#8230;”, “I’d like to understand your point of view better&#8230;”, and “How can we get on the same page?”</li><li>Questions &gt; Answers.</li><li>Curiosity &gt; Judgement.</li><li>Disagree without being disrespectful.</li><li>Difficult conversations are very challenging by nature. It’s ok to accept and remind yourself of that.</li></ul>



<p>Delivering hard feedback is always tough. You may find these resources on our blog additionally useful:</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="429" src="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/first-one-on-one-1024x429.png" alt="first one-on-one meeting with an employee" class="wp-image-5131"/></figure>



<p>If there’s anything you should be supremely focused on as a new manager, it’s your first 1-on-1 meeting with an employee. That first encounter might seem like a formality to you. But in reality, it’s <em>formative</em>.</p>



<p>The first 1-on-1 meeting with an employee sets the tone for your relationship with this person who’ll you’ll work with every day. It’s the one opportunity you have to set a groove, a pattern, for what you want your interactions to be like, and the standard for what feels good going forward. As a result, investing time in preparing for your first 1-on-1 meeting with an employee is a wise use of your time.</p>



<p>But how exactly should you hold this first one-on-one meeting with an employee? Have no fear <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> I’ll share what we’ve learned from over six years of research and working with 15,000+ managers and employees…</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-tell-your-new-hire-why-you-d-like-to-start-holding-one-on-one-meetings-with-them">#1: Tell your new hire why you’d like to start holding one-on-one meetings with&nbsp;them.</h3>



<p>One-on-one meetings are not status updates. One-on-one meetings are not for brainstorming projects. You can talk “the latest” about a project or “what’s next” in another meeting, via email, or even Slack. One-on-one meetings are rare, invaluable time purely to uncover potential issues and share feedback with one another. When else do you ever get the opportunity to do this, face-to-face?</p>



<p>Making this purpose clear is paramount because your employee may have never had one-on-one meetings at their previous job(s) where this was true. Orienting them to this particular purpose of the one-on-one meeting is therefore essential.</p>



<p>Here’s an example of an email you can write explaining this…</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><em>Hey NAME,</em></p><p><em>I was thinking it’d be useful to have regular one-on-one meetings every week or so. I view these meetings as a time for me to really listen to </em>you<em> — to hear what’s on your mind and what you think can be better in the team. It’s also chance for us to both get on the same page, share feedback with one another, and discuss how we can both grow in our respective roles.</em></p><p><em>We can co-write the agendas ahead of time using this (insert tool of your choice here)  — so we together are ensuring we’re talking about the things that matter most.</em></p><p><em>Might you be up for it? Let me know what you think!</em></p><p><em>Warmly,</em></p><p><em>YOUR NAME</em></p></blockquote>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-ask-your-new-hire-what-frequency-and-duration-of-one-on-one-meetings-they-prefer">#2: Ask your new hire what frequency and duration of one-on-one meetings they&nbsp;prefer.</h3>



<p>For these first one-on-one meetings, for how long and how often should you hold them? If the new hire directly reports to you, I recommend weekly one-on-one meetings for 1-hour long for the first 90 days or so. If the new hire doesn’t directly report to you, either a biweekly or monthly one-on-one meeting for 1-hour is likely sufficient.</p>



<p>Regardless, the most important part here is to get input from them on the frequency and duration, in the first place. This way there’s greater buy-in on these meetings happening — it’s not just something you’re demanding and imposing on them.</p>



<p>Here’s more information on <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2018/04/25/one-on-ones-101-with-whom-and-how-often/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">how often you should be holding one-on-one meetings with your employees, depending on your team size</a>.</p>



<p>Are your one-on-one meetings, in fact, skip-level meetings? You may want to <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2019/10/03/skip-level-meetings-what-they-are-and-exactly-how-to-run-them/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">read this piece here on the frequency of skip-level meetings</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-prepare-an-agenda-with-input-from-your-employee">#3: Prepare an agenda — with input from your employee.</h3>



<p>You’ll want to spend at least 15 minutes brainstorming thoughtful, specific questions you might want to ask. Recall that the purpose of your one-on-one meeting is to uncover potential issues and concerns, so your questions should be targeted around this. For your first one-on-one meeting with an employee, this often means asking prophylactic questions — questions that reveal what the other person’s work preference and expectations are, so you can account for them as a leader.</p>



<p>As an example, here’s an agenda template for your first one-on-one meeting with an employee:</p>



<p><strong><em>Personal connection (10 min.)</em></strong></p>



<ul><li><em>Anything surprise you during your first week or so here?</em></li><li><em>What’s confusing or unclear? Anything you’d like more context on right now?</em></li></ul>



<p><strong><em>Issues (20 min.)</em></strong></p>



<ul><li><em>What can I make sure to do in the next 2 weeks that would help make your onboarding process even smoother?</em></li><li><em>How would you describe your ideal working environment? (E.g., Are you a morning person or afternoon person? Do you prefer more social interaction or solid times of working independently?</em></li><li><em>Do you have any work-related pet peeves? What do you think you tend to be more sensitive to than most, regarding work preferences?</em></li></ul>



<p><strong><em>Career direction (10 min.)</em></strong></p>



<p><strong><em>Next steps + takeaways (5 min.)</em></strong></p>



<p>You’ll also want to invite your employees to write their own questions and add any topics they’d like to discuss on the agenda. This helps the one-on-one meeting feel more like a conversation, rather than a dictation.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-don-t-cancel-the-meeting-only-reschedule-it-if-you-have-too">#4: Don’t cancel the meeting. Only reschedule it if you have&nbsp;too.</h3>



<p>Consistency with one-on-one meetings matter. You speak volumes about how you prioritize the other person’s time with how well you prepare and how consistently you show up for your 1-on-1 meetings with them. Move or cancel your first one-on-one meeting with an employee and it sends the message loud and clear: “Listening to you doesn’t matter that much to me.”</p>



<p>You’ll also want to reflect: How did that meeting go? Did the questions you ask seem to have been useful? Were you fully present and engaged during the meeting, or were you feeling rushed and your mind elsewhere? This will help you calibrate how the one-on-one meeting can be improved for next time.</p>



<p>Don’t sweep this first one-on-one meeting with an employee aside. It’s not a thing that’s getting in the way of the real work. Those emails and to-do lists can wait. The one-on-one meetings you have with your team <em>are</em> the real work. And the first one sets the tone for the rest.</p>

I’m an avid blog reader and podcast listener of Farnam Street myself – and was eager to have  Shane on the show to share his own experience and interpretation of leadership. While Business Insider has called him “Wall Street’s biggest influencer”, on The Heartbeat, Shane was incredibly frank in our podcast conversation about the things he <em>didn’t</em> know as a leader, and his own blindspots he’s learning about day-to-day.</p>

Common sense is rarely common practice. If you ask managers what effectiveness looks like, they often can spell out the critical factors. The key is to get them to act on that insight, and that’s where the obvious can help. We’re naturally creatures of social comparison: When we confront evidence about what good managers do, we want to see how we stack up.  Just as you start conserving electricity when you get social proof that  your neighbors are one-upping you, finding out that good managers meet  individually with their direct reports every month can be enough to get  you to step up.” Written by Adam Grant, MIT Sloan Management Review</p>

<p>Every month, we invite one of the 1,000+ managers who are a part of our leadership community, <a href="http://thewatercooler.io/">The Watercooler</a>, from all over the world to participate in an “Ask Me Anything” (AMA) session. It’s an opportunity for managers, executives, and business owners to gain in-depth insights into management and leadership lessons.&nbsp;This month, we were curious regarding international employment lessons.</p>



<p>Last month, <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2019/11/13/top-9-remote-work-lessons-from-ama-with-sara-sutton-ceo-and-founder-of-flexjobs/">we had an AMA with Sara Sutton</a>, CEO, and Founder of <a href="http://www.flexjobs.com/">FlexJobs</a>, the leading service for professional remote and flexible job opportunities.</p>



<p>Other past guests have included <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2019/10/03/top-7-leadership-lessons-from-ama-with-natalie-gould-cfo-of-balsamiq/">Natalie Gould</a>, CEO of <a href="https://balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a>, <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2017/12/12/leadership-lessons-learned-from-valentina-thorner/">Valentina Thörner</a>, Happiness Team Lead at <a href="https://automattic.com/">Automattic</a>, and <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2018/01/04/top-19-leadership-lessons-learned-from-the-watercooler-ama-with-david-heinemeier-hansson-dhh/">David Heinemeier Hansson</a> (DHH), CTO at <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a>.</p>



<p>Without further ado, I would like to tell you about our December AMA guest, <a href="https://twitter.com/planetburgess">Tim Burgess</a>, co-founder of <a href="https://shieldgeo.com/">Shield GEO</a>. Tim had a lot of international employment lessons to share since every month this company administers the employment and payroll of 550 employees in 60+ countries. Every month on average, they onboard 30 new employees and terminate 15. This is handled by their team of 35, mostly remote staff who are spread across nine countries. Shield GEO is also 80% female, including their whole leadership team, except for the two founders.</p>



<p>Tim is based in Sydney, Australia and started his career as an IT recruiter. After 18 months, they transferred Tim to the UK to run a tiny satellite office that hired contract software developers to work in the UK. He was in a serviced office by himself. His nearest colleague was in Chicago.</p>



<p>In 2001, Tim set up a company with a friend of his to help foreign workers work in the UK. They are now on their third venture together, all of which have involved international employment. In 2009, Tim moved back to Australia, and their other business – helping international contractors with payroll and tax – wasn’t growing fast enough to support his family. He had to get a “proper” job so he spent an intense 18 months doing sales for an IT consulting company. While there, he won a staff voted award that got him into the Business of Software conference in 2010. Listening to <a href="https://www.sethgodin.com/">Seth Godin</a>, <a href="https://robwalling.com/">Rob Walling</a> (<a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/podcast/episode-20-interview-with-rob-walling-founder-of-drip-microconf/">who has been a guest on our podcast, The Heartbeat!</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Reiss">Eric Reiss</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/peldi">Peldi Guilizzoni</a> (<a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/podcast/episode-27-interview-with-peldi-guilizzoni-founder-ceo-of-balsamiq/">another Heartbeat guest as well!</a>) changed Tim and opened up a new path. He realized the value of trial and error. Tim started to look at failure differently and developed an acute interest in being a leader.</p>



<p>Tim told his business partner that he wanted to scale back his part-time involvement in their business and manage the team he was working in. Within months he’d misread the CEO and gotten fired. Tim went crawling back to his friend and their business.</p>



<p>Tim came to understand that he cared deeply about people and how they are treated at work. The pain of that experience is at the core of how he deals with his staff today. Much of his early views of leadership were trying to treat people better than he’d been treated. Tim’s own experience and some messes he has cleaned up for clients has given him strong views on how to fire and hire people with compassion.</p>



<p>I learned so much following Tim’s AMA. Here were the top 7 international employment lessons I learned from him:</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p><strong>Question #1</strong></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“How do you ensure that international workers are fairly compensated? Do you pay in local currency or USD?”</p></blockquote>



<p><strong>Tim’s Answer:</strong></p>



<p>We always pay in local currency and respect local employment requirements. But in some countries where the currency fluctuates a lot, we tie the local compensation to the USD. So we set a salary in the local currency, but we reconcile it against a USD amount. If the employee ends up receiving less than the USD equivalent, we pay an FX bonus in the next cycle to make them whole. Currently, we’ve done that for our people in Argentina, Mexico, and Nicaragua. Honestly, this is the easiest part of the problem.</p>



<p>Fair compensation is a much trickier problem to solve. I’m working on this right now. I had a great chat a few weeks back with <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2019/10/03/top-7-leadership-lessons-from-ama-with-natalie-gould-cfo-of-balsamiq/">Natalie Gould</a>, of <a href="http://balsamiq.com">Balsamiq</a> recently as she’s also thinking about this same problem.</p>



<p><strong>We have a set of compensation principles. Here they are:</strong></p>



<ul><li>We have a transparent, fair and equitable remuneration process</li><li>Your location determines your remuneration and statutory entitlements</li><li>We have market rate salary levels for all roles and locations</li><li>We provide monthly and annual allowances to enable our team members to work flexibly (Telecomm), support their wellbeing (HWBA), and an annual travel allowance (“work-ation”)</li><li>Everyone shares in the company success via an annual profit share based on tenure and seniority.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Pay raises are based on:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Progression through role levels in the competency framework</li><li>Promotion to new or different role</li><li>Annual pay raise to reflect market adjustment or CIP/WPI/inflation</li></ul>



<p>But we’re still working on putting them in place. Principles are great and all… but living up to them is much harder.</p>



<p>I’m getting challenged by some of our staff on this. Money is a big thing! The principles have been helpful to give me guidance. For example, some people are really fixated on pay for performance. That’s not us. We don’t want to measure people too closely. We don’t want to compare them or make them compete against each other. We are resistant to bringing in metrics and measurement, which we just don’t want right now. And it would bring a lot of subjective judgment and opportunity for bias.</p>



<p>The hardest part for me right now is that we don’t really know what is a market rate for all our roles in all our locations. Market data from companies like Radford is expensive. Some of our jobs are a bit niche. And some of our hiring locations are unusual for those jobs. Which means the data might not actually be that helpful. But we do need a way to identify a fair salary and make it suitably transparent, so our people agree or propose improvements. What I’m leaning towards is picking one location where we can get good publicly available data, where we can hire for all the roles that we want. We are confident that our compensation is fair in that market — and then building a formula to localize in other countries/cities based on the comparative cost of living. It won’t be perfect, but it should give us a big enough pool of folks we could hire and retain.</p>



<p><strong>Question #2</strong></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“Tim went crawling back to his friend and their business.”</p></blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“How did this conversation go? What did you say to your business partner, and how did he receive your apology? Was there any awkwardness, or did things just go back to normal right away?”</p></blockquote>



<p><strong>Tim’s Answer:</strong></p>



<p>HAHAHA. I wasn’t sure anyone would pick up on that. It was so embarrassing. Looking back, I really took a vote of no confidence in the business… and fell flat on my face. All within a couple of months. And yet he accepted me back.</p>



<p>He’s a really amazing friend, and he was so matter-of-fact about it. I mean, obviously, he laughed at me for a while. But it got back to normal very quickly.</p>



<p>I’m sure in some small way he was relieved. It’s not that he wanted me to leave. And it’s a lot to run a business by yourself. It’s much more enjoyable and less stressful doing it together.</p>



<p><strong>Question #3</strong></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“Could you share how you deal with timezone differences between 9 countries? Do you require a minimum overlap?”</p></blockquote>



<p><strong>Tim’s Answer:</strong></p>



<p>Timezones are a pain, but from the beginning, our clients and partners have been all over the world. So it’s part of our DNA. Communication has been an important part of making it work. But first, I’ll cover the logistics of how we are constructed.</p>



<p>Our biggest team is nine people located in Spain, the UK, Mexico &amp; the USA. That is a 7-hour spread, but they get enough crossover to have their weekly calls. This is the only one where we’ve consciously hired for timezone because most of our clients are in the USA and Europe.</p>



<p>Our second biggest team is eight people based in Sydney, Singapore, the Philippines, and Hong Kong. That’s only a 3-hour spread. (Fun fact: 25% of the world population is within 3 hours of Sydney where I am based.)</p>



<p>We have some small teams like terminations (three people in Argentina, the USA, and the Philippines) and implementation (four people in Italy, the UK, the Philippines, and Sydney), which have a broader spread already. It works great in terms of client services because they cover almost 24/7. But the team members suffer a bit. They don’t spend much time together. And they don’t get as much opportunity to work collaboratively. Which impacts on process improvements.</p>



<p>I look forward to those teams growing so they can have a little more regional cohesion.</p>



<p>We are planning for scaling teams into new timezones. We will try to keep some overlap as we do it. So we just hired a finance person in Portugal. And we chose an experienced generalist who can help with training new finance folks in this new timezone. And with her experience, she’s also going to be more comfortable interfacing with other teams. She’s an early riser, and one of our managers in Asia works late. So they will get a few hours per day together.</p>



<p>But whether there is overlap or not, we have a real focus on written communication and over-communicating in general. By overcommunication, I mean giving extra context when writing to someone. For example, when answering someone in the UK, I’m going to try to anticipate any follow-up questions they might have and answer them in advance. I’m not just giving them an answer; I’m also explaining how I made the decision. And hoping that saves them needing to ask more questions because every additional reply means another 24 hours of waiting.</p>



<p>We put things in public (i.e., <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/">Salesforce</a>, <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>, <a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a>) so that knowledge isn’t stored in silos. We are slowly getting better at documenting decisions and taking notes from meetings.</p>



<p>For a while now, we’ve been filtering applicants on this, so we only add people who default to written communication. And we’ve been coaching the folks that we hired before we realized how important it was.</p>



<p>And then we supplement it with lots of social interaction, so we get a richer picture of each other. <a href="https://twitter.com/sytses">Sid Sijbrandij</a> from <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">Gitlab</a> says it so well when he talks about the need to <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/informal-communication/">be intentional about informal communication.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>We use <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>, <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/">Know Your Team</a>, <a href="https://www.donut.com/">Donut.ai</a>, and we run regular regional <a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a> chats. We also have a weekly internal newsletter, an ongoing series on how people structure their day. Over the last few months, we’ve been recording AMAs, like this, but on Zoom with our journalist asking the questions, with our internal staff. This means there are a whole bunch of ways that our people can interact with each other. And those connections are super important for empathy and trust.</p>



<p><strong>Question #4</strong></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“Could you share more about your growth, sales, and marketing strategy? How do you acquire new customers? I see that you have a sales and a marketing team, with about five people on each team. How are these two teams organized?”</p></blockquote>



<p><strong>Tim’s Answer:</strong></p>



<p>Growth, sales, and marketing. That’s a big question, but they are all so closely linked! But I guess our foundational strategy could be summed up as “provide the best service we can, and good things will happen.”</p>



<p>Our sales are founded on inbound web traffic from organic content marketing. And it basically always has been. We had a crucial partnership in the early days of the business, but we outgrew it. And haven’t had much success building other partnerships.</p>



<p>We don’t do any outbound sales. I’m sure it could bring revenue. But Duncan, my co-founder, and I have done that in previous careers, and we hated it. So we’ve not done it up until now. Instead, our four-person sales team (we call them customer success) handles inbound leads and works to understand what they need and whether we can help. It is high touch consultative work. They want to make sure the client knows exactly what is involved. If the client agrees to go ahead, they get handed over to our onboarding team. The sales team is pretty flat and currently re-organizing as it grows. But it’s basically a manager, two sales staff and a trainee. We will add sales operations early next year.</p>



<p>We do need to do something to broaden where leads come from. We’ve dabbled in SEM but never had great returns. That’s a background goal for the next year. We’ll probably start with drilling more into our existing customers and trying to get referrals.</p>



<p>Marketing has shifted over the last few years. We’ve always done a lot of writing, mostly using freelancers and interns. But this year we hired a journalist on staff, and that has been amazing. I cannot recommend this highly enough; journalists are the best. We also found a freelance illustrator whose work we love. And that has changed how we view our brand. So the team is now a product marketing manager, journalist, freelance copywriter, freelance illustrator. And we are in the final stages of hiring a digital marketing person.</p>



<p>Marketing initially focused on explaining our service. Looking back, we started off insecure and wanting to show or build credibility. Then we shifted to what does it do for the customer, what the benefits are for them. This was much better. Customers don’t care so much about the details of what we do; they want to solve their problem and get on with their own stuff.</p>



<p>And over the last year, we’ve shifted to also incorporate who we are and what we believe. We understand that we don’t want all customers, just the good ones that value similar things to us. So we are sharing those values and building our brand as a way for customers to self-select. We want it to be easy for them to know who we are and whether they want to use us. If you like the things we like, we should be really attractive. If you don’t… you’re going to go elsewhere.</p>



<p>There is a ton of luck and privilege in this position. And we might be making a terrible mistake! But it feels right for us at the moment.</p>



<p>Part of the privilege is tied to growth.</p>



<p>Growth is not something we’ve worried about that much. We are lucky in that we’re in a market that is growing of itself. And we have some larger competitors who are spending money and effort to raise awareness of the service. That is difficult and expensive marketing. We are grateful they are doing it. So we figure we can, to an extent, ride their coattails. They do the heavy lifting, and we can spend our meager resources on brand and how we are different. It means we don’t grow as fast as them.</p>



<p>But also as a bootstrapped company operating in a complex service, we want to grow in a constrained way. We are a service business built around people. If we grow, we have to hire.</p>



<p>We’ve had a couple of times that our growth has gotten away from us, and it has led to so much stress. Teams have gotten overloaded, people have worked overtime, processes broke down, there was infighting and resentment. And we made mistakes, and our service level dropped. We eventually dug our way out of that by prioritizing colleagues first, customers second, growth third. And by being more clear on who we wanted as customers. We’re not perfect now, but so much better.</p>



<p>It’s been interesting reading <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20995453/away-luggage-ceo-steph-korey-toxic-work-environment-travel-inclusion">the Away article</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I relate to their overload in CX. Those mistakes of overstuffing your funnel are really easy to make. I’d imagine this would be increased with the pressure associated with VC funding. I don’t want to dump on Away or their leadership. That is a really tough spot to be in, especially early in your leadership journey. The one thing I will say is that if when we experienced the stress of uncontrolled growth, we eventually turned the tap off a bit, which slowed the onslaught of new customers. And it bought us some breathing space.</p>



<p><strong>Question #5</strong></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“What’s the biggest thing you’ve learned this year?”</p></blockquote>



<p><strong>Tim’s Answer:</strong></p>



<p>Great question. It’s really hard to cut it down to just one thing.</p>



<p>The biggest thing was realizing that every opinion, blog post, article, etc. is just a data point. And that trying to apply things verbatim will often fail because every situation and company is a little unique. This was a source of frustration to me for the longest time. I’d read something and try to apply it straight away, it wouldn’t work, and then I’d think it was because we were terrible. Or I was terrible.</p>



<p>But actually, it’s better to take all the data and go back to the underlying principles of what we’re trying to do. And then think things through from there. That leads to answers which match our situation and company. And that has been working much better so far!</p>



<p><strong>Question #6</strong></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“I was moved by the idea of firing people with compassion. How do you do that?”</p></blockquote>



<p><strong>Tim’s Answer:</strong></p>



<p>I would say that it is a work in progress. But over the last few years, I’ve been involved in quite a few situations where people have been fired. In particular, I’m considering being fired for performance. A few times internally and much more with our clients as part of our service. For a few years, whenever there was a termination for our clients that was going bad, it would get escalated to me.</p>



<p>I think other types of terminations like economic redundancy are much easier for everyone to process. Even gross misconduct is arguably more clear because there needs to have been a big incident.</p>



<p>But performance is more nebulous, more open to interpretation. And it is never one incident. It’s the buildup of many small things over time. So it is especially complicated and filled with emotion.</p>



<p>Early on, I felt compelled to inject myself into the situation. To talk directly with the people involved, especially the employee, and find out what is going on. It started, quite honestly, from the point of managing risk. I wanted to make sure that if we went to a labor tribunal that I’d had a chance to solve it first.</p>



<p>Once I started talking to the employee, there was always a lot to unpack. They haven’t been happy. They have lots of frustration. They feel misunderstood and rejected. Sometimes they feel outraged. And I wanted to move them away from those feelings if I could. I realized over time that it wasn’t really about “moving them away from those feelings” but acknowledging them. And admitting they were valid. It really helps if I’m not the line manager in this type of conversation because I don’t want it to be an argument about what happened, just acknowledging how they feel.</p>



<p>But ultimately, I want them to think about the future because they have responsibility for their life, career, professional (and personal) pride, and happiness. And I think it is hard for them to focus on those if they are stuck with something that is now in the past.</p>



<p>It has happened.</p>



<p>They have been fired.</p>



<p>That cannot change.</p>



<p>A lot of this stemmed from my own experience of being “managed out” of a role. And that helps me relate to people. I think it builds some credibility. I don’t talk at length about my experience, but it means I am very honest and transparent about their situation and their options.</p>



<p>Over time this has become a clearer set of principles. We want people to feel understood. To still feel valued as a person even though they might feel rejected. To give them chances to preserve or regain their dignity and sense of control.</p>



<p>And if there is any kindness or concession that we can show them, we do. Sometimes even the most trivial things make a difference. For example, I recently fired someone for performance, and I made sure they saw our internal announcement before it went out. They wanted to remove a sentence, so we did it.</p>



<p>It’s never going to be a great experience. But our aim is that by approaching this with an open heart and humility, coupled with the strength of knowing what we need to do and what the boundaries are, that we can give them the “least worst” experience possible. It’s really hard but rewarding.</p>



<p>It’s been fairly successful so far. There’s one time we haven’t been able to bring it to an acceptable conclusion. It still bugs me.</p>



<p><strong>Question #7</strong></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“I know from our conversations that you also are working on updating your salary system.&nbsp;</p><p>One element we didn’t speak about much was how an individual employee’s levels/skills in the competency matrix are evaluated and updated.</p><p>Can you tell us more about things like who is involved, how often it is done, and any methodology you have for this?</p><p>I know you are in transition, so it may be a mixture of what you have done, what you are doing, and problems you are still trying to solve!”</p></blockquote>



<p><strong>Tim’s Answer:</strong></p>



<p>The competency matrix is still early in its implementation. We’ve rolled it to just over half the company so far.</p>



<p>For our main roles, we’ve created three competency levels (1,2,3) to recognize increased mastery of the role.</p>



<p>The employee does a self-assessment against the matrix. It’s an excel file, and they mark each cell with green (mastered this), yellow (working on this), or white (not thinking about this yet).</p>



<p>At the same time, the manager does the same process.</p>



<p>Then once the manager has completed their assessment, we give them the employee version. The manager compares them and then talks about the differences in the next 1:1. We’ve only done this once so far, but it has been really powerful. They can share expectations and have a framework for clarifying them!</p>



<p>Then if there are areas in the current level that need improvement, the manager can put them onto the agenda. If the person wants to develop to the next level, they mutually agree on what areas to prioritize. And then talk about what they can do to learn or demonstrate that competency.</p>



<p>Sometimes it is a new skill. Sometimes it is a skill they haven’t been able to show with us yet.</p>



<p>We plan to revisit these every three months. Not to do the whole assessment every three months – just to check in on the areas they are working on and how they are progressing. But that’s just our plan for now. We’ll see how it actually plays out.</p>



<p><strong>Some detail on the levels and how we created it:</strong></p>



<p>Our HR person built an empty template based on our technical skills, communications skills, and our company values – and then worked with three of our managers to help them map it out. There was a lot of back and forth about what the difference between the levels was. And what level of granularity to use when describing the individual competencies. We did some test runs. And continue to fine-tune it.</p>



<p><strong>In essence:</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Level 1</strong> is focussed on the individual and their tasks. They can do the job, but their attention is focussed just on doing their job. They can flag areas for improvement.</li><li><strong>Level 2</strong> is where the individual starts to become more team focussed in their role. They are confident in their own tasks and can interact more with others; they don’t need as much direction. And they understand how their role interfaces with their direct touchpoints. They can flag areas for improvement and are expected to be able to make suggestions on how to improve them.</li><li><strong>Level 3</strong> is where they can’t really get better at the tasks within the role. They understand everything. Not just their role and the team, they also see the big picture of how their role interfaces with the overall process or company. They mentor Level 1 and Level 2. They can make decisions on improvements.</li></ul>



<p>We looked at a bunch of other companies’ frameworks for this, and they were pretty similar. Some were really detailed. Some very complex (like 12 levels of engineering!). Three levels feels right for us for now. And for our junior roles, we’ve only got 1 level.</p>



<p>Lastly, we’ve currently only done this for the areas where we have multiple people doing the same role. I’ve got to start on my team, which is mostly people who are the only ones doing their job at the company. Creating the levels based on what we want from the role, instead of based on the person doing it, is going to be challenging.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Someone put in their resignation notice. Hoo boy. Here&#8217;s how to conduct an exit interview that is useful, graceful, and candid.</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="441" src="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/exit-interviews-1024x441.png" alt="" class="wp-image-5038"/></figure>



<p>&#8220;How to conduct an exit interview?&#8221; I recently was asked this by an executive who is a <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2019/12/05/exciting-im-now-offering-one-on-one-leadership-coaching/">1:1 leadership coaching client</a> of mine. He&#8217;d become the CEO of his company only a month ago, and it was the first time someone had resigned since he&#8217;d assumed his new role.</p>



<p>&#8220;Congrats&#8221; was the first thing I told him. And no, I wasn&#8217;t being facetious. While someone resigning might not seem like a moment worthy of &#8220;congrats,&#8221; it&#8217;s an important milestone to take note of. When someone leaves, you send a message about how you want to treat <em>everyone</em> at your company –&nbsp;not just the people who join.</p>



<p>Additionally, an exit interview is a singular chance to understand your team and your company on a closer level:  Who knows better what can be improved in your organization other than a person who is choosing to leave it?  </p>



<p>The question is:  How to conduct an exit interview that actually elicits a candid perspective from the person who&#8217;s leaving?  One that actually is steeped in deep reflection, and doesn&#8217;t come from a reactionary fear of &#8220;saying the wrong thing&#8221; or burning bridges. </p>



<p>Based on conversations with hundreds of managers and executives who I&#8217;ve <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2019/12/05/exciting-im-now-offering-one-on-one-leadership-coaching/">coached</a> both formally and informally, and the research we&#8217;ve done specifically on exit interview best practices, here&#8217;s how to conduct an exit interview.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Know the purpose&nbsp;– for yourself, and for your company. </h3>



<p>An exit interview is not an interrogation. Nor is it a venting session. It&#8217;s an opportunity to get an accurate picture of someone&#8217;s experience at your team –&nbsp;and what you and the company could be doing better. It&#8217;s not a time to take them leaving personally. It&#8217;s a moment of reflection and insight into how much better things could be.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Set it up right: Ahead of time and with clarity.</h3>



<p>Once the person has resigned, let them know that you’d like to hold an exit interview with as much time in advance. Explain the purpose ahead of time, clearly: The discussion is about learning about their experience at the company, so the company can become better in the future, for current and future employees. Share that you plan to incorporate their feedback into changing things going forward. Emphasize that you’re incredibly appreciative they’re willing to take the time to be open with you and give you their time. I&#8217;d recommend setting aside at least an hour and up to 90 minutes for the conversation so it doesn’t feel rushed.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Hold the exit interview one-on-one.</h3>



<p>When you&#8217;re considering how to conduct an exit interview, holding it one-on-one is key. While you may want HR and/or a leadership team member there, a panel-style exit interview is intimidating. Furthermore, it&#8217;s ideal to conduct the exit interview either in-person or by phone. An in-person exit interview will help create rapport since they can see your body language and look you in the eye. But talking via phone can make things easier for someone to be honest and relieve the pressure of having to give a &#8220;perfect&#8221; answer since some folks get more nervous having an in-person conversation. Both are factors to weigh when deciding the precise format of the <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/one_on_ones/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">one-on-one</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Pick a person who will be most fair and effective to conduct it.</h3>



<p>Most companies have their HR department conduct the exit interview, but that is typically true for larger companies. For smaller companies, the person who is conducting the exit interview should be two things:  (1) They should be on the same page with you and the leadership team about what the goals of the exit interview are, what questions to ask, and the tone to establish during the conversation. (2) Most importantly, the person conducting the exit interview should be perceived by the person who’s leaving as the most fair, effective person to be conducting the interview. You’re trying to maximize honesty and forthrightness – and that only comes if the person who is conducting the interview is someone who the interviewee trusts, and someone who <em>you</em> <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/culture_questions/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">trust</a> to relay the information back well. Because of this, you don&#8217;t usually want the person&#8217;s direct supervisor to conduct the exit interview, but the person who is one-step above their direct supervisor. This gives some space for the interviewee to speak more freely about their relationship with their supervisor. And, it also shows that you&#8217;re taking the conversation seriously and want to act and follow-up effectively (which is harder to believe if the person conducting the exit interview is, for example, a fellow individual contributor or the person&#8217;s direct supervisor).</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Give it 30 or 90 days to get an honest perspective.</h3>



<p>Experts go back and forth on when to conduct the exit interview. Some folks recommend doing it about a month or a few weeks before the person leaves because the person is still engaged in their role. I tend to think the opposite (and have found with <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/m/features/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=cta">Know Your Team</a> customers we work with to be the case): Try holding the exit interview a month or so after the person has left the position, so there’s less pressure to give sugar-coated responses. One month after, they’re more relaxed, and they’re more likely to be frank with you about why they left and how your company can improve.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Ask questions beyond the expected, &#8220;Why did you leave?&#8221;</h3>



<p>Try asking these questions that most managers overlook during your exit interview:</p>



<ul><li>What would you say was the biggest reason that contributed to you leaving the company?</li><li>While you were deciding between staying or leaving the company, what were some of the biggest factors you weighed in your decision?</li><li>What did you most appreciate while working at the company?</li><li>What were some of your biggest points of frustration while you were at the company?</li><li>If you started at the company all over again, what might be one thing you wish the company would’ve handled differently?</li><li>In what ways was the relationship with your manager helpful?</li><li>In what ways was the relationship with your manager frustrating or irksome?</li><li>Who are you most grateful to have worked with while at the company?</li><li>What advice would you give to the leadership team about making the company better?</li><li>What was the biggest gap between what you observed was the company’s intention, versus what was exhibited in reality?</li><li>Where do you think the company has the biggest opportunity to get better?</li><li>What should we look for in the next person we hire for your role?</li><li>As now an “alum” of the company, what can the company do – if anything – to support your career progression?</li><li>Is there anything else you think we should know, in order to improve the company for current and future employees?</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Calibrate your reaction during the exit interview.</h3>



<p>Don’t defend. Don’t deflect. Don’t try to fix the issue in the moment. Listen, be appreciative, and thank them for their candor. Your goal is to create an environment that makes it as safe as possible for them to be honest. The more honest they are, the more you’ll learn what will be beneficial for the company.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Create consistency.</h3>



<p>The bigger your team gets, the more likely having exit interviews will happen. It&#8217;s a natural byproduct of scale. As a result,  I’d recommend creating setting a consistent process for how to conduct exit interviews. When you have a uniform series of questions to ask and deliberate structure to the interviews, if/when someone leaves again, you have a similar set of data to compare notes to.</p>



<p>Of course, there is no magical this-works-for-everyone approach for how to conduct an exit interview. In fact, they can massively backfire if you simply sit on the information you receive from them, or you become overly defensive during them. Rather, view an exit interview as a tool, when utilized properly, can mark a peaceful and graceful transition for both you and the person leaving. </p>



<p>Remember:  Congratulations.  Someone leaving is an opportunity, if you choose to see it as such. </p>
